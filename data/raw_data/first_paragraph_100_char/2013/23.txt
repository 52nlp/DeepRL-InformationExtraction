One person died following a shooting late Saturday night in Springfield. Just before midnight police and medics were called to the Night Owl Bar at 601 W. Main St. for a fight. Springfield Police Chief Steve Moody said that when officers arrived on the scene, they found a gunshot victim inside the bar. Moody said that person later died. Moody added that three other victims with gunshot wounds showed up at Springfield Regional Medical Center. Because they were victims of violence, Moody said officers were stationed at the hospital to increase security. They also answered questions of family members who arrived there.
