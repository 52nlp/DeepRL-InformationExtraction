LAKE BUTLER | A longtime employee of a Florida trucking company was once very close with his former boss, even known as his right-hand man. But police say Hubert Allen Jr. drove around Saturday and shot former co-workers and his onetime boss, killing the ex-employer and another man before turning a gun on himself.
