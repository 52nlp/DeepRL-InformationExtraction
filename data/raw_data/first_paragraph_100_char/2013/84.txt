Shootings in Philadelphia left two people dead, one paralyzed and five others wounded Tuesday night. The shootings happened across the city on the unusually warm evening and are not thought to be related. The first incident happened on a crowded Kensington street at about 6 p.m., when a woman was killed and three men were hurt near Somerset and Lee streets. The 20-year-old woman was shot twice in the torso and taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The three men were hospitalized in stable condition.
