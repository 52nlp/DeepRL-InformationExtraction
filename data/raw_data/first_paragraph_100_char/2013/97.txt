Jefferson Parish sheriff's deputies arrested at least four people in an early Monday morning shooting in Harvey that left five people injured, including three young children and two women, authorities said. According to John Fortunato, spokesman for the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, about 4:30 a.m. Second District patrol officers were at a school across the street from an apartment complex in the 2300 block of Lapalco Boulevard when they heard the tires of a car screeching and saw a car speeding out of the driveway of the apartment complex. Shortly thereafter, Fortunato said, the officers began receiving multiple reports of shots that had been fired.
