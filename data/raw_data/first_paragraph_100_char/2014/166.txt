Guy: AND OUR LAUREN PODELL HAS MORE NOW ON THE YOUNG LIVES LOST IN THIS SENSELESS ACT OF VIOLENCE. Lauren: 18-YEAR-OLD AUNDREA GARLAND, SHE WAS SHOT AND KILLED BEHIND ME ON THIS FRONT PORCH. SHE WAS ABOUT TO START HER SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL. WE SPOKE WITH HER MOTHER MARGARET, WHO DIDN'T WANT US TO SHOW HER FACE BUT WANTS EVERYONE TO KNOW WHO HER DAUGHTER IS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO WITHOUT MY BABY. Lauren: SHE WAS AT HER FRIEND'S HOUSE ON EDMORE, A HOME DETROIT POLICE SURROUNDED THIS MORNING. SHE AND THREE OTHER PEOPLE WERE OUTSIDE ON THE FRONT PORCH WHEN A RED OR BURGUNDY SATURN PULLED UP BEFORE MIDNIGHT, A PASSENGER GOT OUT AND FIRED SHOTS, SHOTS HER MOTHER COULD HEAR A FEW STREETS OVER. THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND IT WAS HER FRIEND'S MOTHER AND SHE SAID TO COME WITH HER BECAUSE SHE WAS AT THE HOSPITAL AND HAD BEEN SHOT. WHEN I GOT THERE, THEY TOLD ME MY BABY WAS DEAD. Lauren: DETROIT POLICE FOUND A BURNED-OUT SATURN MATCHING THE VEHICLE DESCRIPTION. IT WAS NEVER PARKED THERE BEFORE IT WENT UP IN FLAMES THIS MORNING. YOU CAN SEE BULLET HOLES AND A CHAIR. THE FRONT DOOR AND THE NEIGHBOR'S WINDOW. SHE WAS ABOUT TO START HER SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL AND NOW WILL NEVER GET THE CHANCE TO FINISH. I DIDN'T WANT HER OUT BECAUSE OF THE SHOOTING AT THE EASTLAND MALL AND SHE SAID, MOM, YOU'RE PARANOID, YOU WORRY TOO MUCH. Lauren: A FEW HOURS AFTER THIS SHOOTING, THERE WAS A SHOOTING SIX BLOCKS AWAY ON EAST STATE FAIR. DETROIT POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE THREE SHOOTINGS ARE CONNECTED.
