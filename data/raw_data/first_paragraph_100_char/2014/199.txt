OF 3-YEAR-OLD AMIRACLE WILLIAMS. GOOD EVENING AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US FOR LOCAL 4 NEWS AT 5:00! THE FIRST CHARGES CAME TODAY IN THIS TRULY TRAGIC CASE. Devin: WAYNE COUNTY PROSECUTOR SAYS DONNIE EVERETT WAS INVOLVED IN THE SENSELESS SHOOTING THAT STARTED WITH A FACEBOOK FEUD. Carmen: OUR ROGER WEBER WAS IN COURT AS THE CHARGES BECAME OFFICIAL. GOOD EVENING, ROGER! Roger: GOOD EVENING! THIS BRINGS A SMALL MEASURE OF RELIEF TO THE GIRL'S FAMILY KNOWING THAT A MAN IS IN CUSTODY AND CHARGED WITH MURDER. FIVE PEOPLE IN ALL WERE SHOT HERE ON MOGUL STREET. AMIRACLE'S TEENAGE SISTER WAS INVOLVED IN A FEUD ON SOCIAL MEDIA. AMIRACLE WAS BARELY OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW HER ABCs. 24-YEAR-OLD DONNIE EVERETT OF DETROIT IS THE MAN POLICE SAY KILLED THE LITTLE GIRL AND WOUNDED THREE OTHERS, CHARGED WITH FIRST-DEGREE MURDER, FELONY MURDER, FIVE COUNTS OF ASSAULT WITH INTENT TO MURDER AND WEAPONS CHARGES. RELATIVES OF THE GIRL ARE RELIEVED TO SEE CHARGES FILED. I THINK HE DESERVES THE DEATH PENALTY BECAUSE FOR ANYBODY TO WALK UP TO A 3-YEAR-OLD AND SHOOT THEM IN THE CHEST TWICE, THEY DESERVE THE DEATH SENTENCE. Roger: THE GRANDMOTHER IS DEVASTATED BUT WILLING TO FORGIVE. I WILL STILL PRAY FOR HIM. Roger: A VAN FULL OF PEOPLE CAME TO THE HOME LOOKING FOR AMIRACLE'S TEENAGE SISTER. HE OPENED FIRE AND THE FATHER FIRED ONE SHOT WOUNDING THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE. THEY TALK ABOUT THE WAR IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, BUT IT'S A WAR HERE IN THE CITY OF DETROIT. Roger: AMIRACLE'S MOTHER WAS WOUNDED AND OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. THE FATHER IS STILL A PATIENT. HE'S UPGRADED, IN STABLE CONDITION. EVERETT HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IN VIRGINIA AND HELD WITHOUT BOND. AND THIS AFTERNOON, THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE CORRECTED THE AGE OF THE DEFENDANT. EVERETT IS 23, NOT 24 YEARS OLD. AMIRACLE'S FAMILY HOPES TO HAVE A FUNERAL ON SATURDAY AND THEY WILL RELEASE DETAILS LATER IN THE WEEK. REPORTING LIVE IN DETROIT, I'M ROGER WEBER, LOCAL 4. Carmen: CERTAINLY A LOT OF QUESTIONS HERE. BUT THESE CHARGES ARE VERY SERIOUS, ROGER. ARE MORE CHARGES COMING? Roger: DETROIT POLICE HAVE SPECIFICALLY SOUGHT A WARRANT AGAINST THE 22-YEAR-OLD DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE, THE PERSON WOUNDED BY AMIRACLE'S FATHER AND IS RECOVERING FROM INJURIES. BUT THIS IS QUITE A WIDE RAPING AIRPORT PACKAGE, AND THE
