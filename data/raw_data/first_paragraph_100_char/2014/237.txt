ANDREW PEREZ, BACK TO YOU. AT 4:30, A TEENAGER LEFT IF CRITICAL CONDITION IN THE HOSPITAL AFTER BEING HIT IN A DRIVE-BY SHOOTING. THE DRIVE BY HAPPENED ON MONDAY AFTERNOON AT A NORTHWEST MIAMI-DADE PARK. NINE PEOPLE WERE SHOT AND THE FOCUS IS ON THE SEARCH FOR THE GUNMAN. WE ARE LIVE OUTSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL WITH AN UPDATE. Reporter: SOME OF THOSE GRAZE WOUNDS THAT A TOTAL OF NINE VICTIMS HIT, BUT THE MOST SERIOUSLY INJURED BRYCE, WHO WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD. REMARKABLY, HIS FAMILY TELLS US THAT HE IS EXPECTED TO RECOVER FROM HIS INJURIES AND HE IS ALREADY TALKING, BUT THREE OF THOSE VICTIMS ARE 16 YEARS OLD. LET'S SHOW YOU ANOTHER VICTIM, HIS NAME GARRETT JOHNSON, A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT. HE WAS SHOT THREE TIMES IN THAT SAME DRIVE-BY SHOOTING JUST SOME OF THE STORIES AND SOME OF THE VICTIMS THAT WE ARE NOW PUTTING TOGETHER IN THIS MASS SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED JUST YESTERDAY IN NORTHWEST MIAMI-DADE. LET'S TAKE AU BACK TO THE SCENE NOW, OUR COLLET LAKES PARK AT NORTHWEST 8th STREET, AND 17th AVENUE, A LARGE GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE ON CHRISTMAS BREAK WERE IN THAT PARK. THEY WERE SIMPLY ON THE COURT PLAYING BASKETBALL WHEN POLICE TELL US THAT A DARK-COLORED NISSAN MAXIMA DROVE BY AND SOMEONE INSIDE OF THAT CAR PULLED OUT A CAR AND SPRAYED THE CROWD. THE SHOOTER DROVE OFF IMMEDIATELY AND HAS NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE. HE LEFT A TOTAL OF NINE SHOOTING VICTIMS. THIS AFTERNOON THE FAMILIES ARE PRAYING THAT THEY HAVE A SPEEDY RECOVERY. WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN TO HEAR FROM THE MOTHER OF THE TEENAGER WHO WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD. LET'S LISTEN IN. SOME INSENSITIVE PERSON TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO SHOOT AT THE PARK THESE INNOCENT PEOPLE. MY SON COULD HAVE BEEN GONE. I HAD NO IDEA THAT THEY WOULD BE SHOOTING AT YOUNG KIDS LIKE THAT. DRIVE-BY SHOOTING, THAT IS RIDICULOUS. YOU DON'T KNOW WHO -- YOU'RE GOING TO HURT. AND WHY THOSE BULLETS WERE FIRED IN THAT PARK, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT MIAMI-DADE DETECTIVES THIS AFTERNOON ARE STILL TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF, THAT THESE NINE FAMILIES DO HAVE SOMETHING TO SMILE ABOUT THIS HOLIDAY SEASON BECAUSE EVERYONE WHO WAS SHOT INCLUDING THAT 16-YEAR-OLD WHO WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD ARE AGAIN, EXPECTED TO RECOVER FROM THEIR INJURIES.
