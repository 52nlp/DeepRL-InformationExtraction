Greenwood police were investigating the fatal shooting after Malik died and four others were injured during the shooting along Tabor Street. Greenwood County Coroner Sonny Cox said Padgett died from a single gunshot to the chest. "He had hopes and dreams for his life, he wanted to go to college and someone took that away from him," said Latarsha Padgett. Latarsha Padgett said they were visiting Greenwood on Malik's spring break. On Sunday, Latarsha Padgett begged for her son's shooter to turn themselves in.
