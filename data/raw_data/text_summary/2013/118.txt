A rolling gun battle in Vallejo late Wednesday night sent four people to the hospital. A local resident called because (the shooting victims) had been banging on their door, so we were able to pick (the shooting victims) up as well," said Vallejo Police Sgt. The victims' car crashed when the driver was shot. The shooter's car fled the scene. All police have been told is that the shooter was in a white small car and they do not have suspect description.
