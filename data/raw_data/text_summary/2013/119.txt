VALLEJO (CBS SF) – Police in Vallejo are investigating a shooting that left four people hospitalized on Wednesday night, a police lieutenant said. After the shooting, the victims’ car crashed into a parked car, he said. Moments later, residents of nearby Betty Court called 911 after victims of the shooting knocked on their doors seeking help, Horton said.
