PHOENIX — A birthday party in north Phoenix turned deadly Sunday. “That age group, it just shocks you when those are the individuals involved in this type of activity,” Thompson said. They have little vehicle or suspect information and want to hear from anyone with information. Tommy Thompson told KTAR that two of the victims are 16 and 17. Jason Jonathan Acosta-Ramos, 18, who was celebrating his birthday, and Elliseo Cantu, 16, were killed.
