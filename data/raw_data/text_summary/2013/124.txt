PHOENIX - Police say a second teen has died after a drive-by shooting disrupted a birthday party in a Phoenix neighborhood early Sunday morning. Acosta-Ramos' friends are holding a car wash on Monday, April 15 to raise money for his funeral arrangements. Evelyn Ruiz and her brother Ruben were invited by Acosta-Ramos to the birthday party but couldn't go because of work. An 18-year-old victim was driven to the hospital by friends where he later died from his injuries, Thompson said. Ruiz said Acosta-Ramos had just come back from visiting his mother in Mexico and was looking forward to celebrating his birthday at home.
