Bodies of four adults found in basement of Ohio townhouse after being shot execution style in the faceThe bodies of four adults have been found in the basement of a northeast Ohio townhouse after being shot execution style in the face, according to authorities. Photos of the complex showed crime scene tape cordoning off one area as officers canvassed for information about what happened. Ohio.com reports one of the victims was a man named Ronald Roberts. The bodies were all in the home's basement but relatives were told shell casings were discovered on two separate floors, Ohio.com reports. The units, in an older, small complex near a mall are normally quiet and don't have a history of crime, O'Leary said.
