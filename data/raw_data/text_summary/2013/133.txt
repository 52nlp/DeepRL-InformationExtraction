A shooting that left five people dead at a Federal Way apartment complex Sunday started as a case of domestic violence, police said Monday. It ended with a woman the suspect was living with and three innocent bystanders dead before police shot and killed the suspect. Eight Federal Way Police officers are on paid administrative leave, which is standard procedure after an officer-involved shooting. He had no prior criminal history, but was involved in two previous domestic violence calls in Seattle and Federal Way.
