"We were just sitting in the car and that's when we heard the shots, like POW POW POW â€” about eight or nine shots," said Brenda Ford. Ford said her 32-year-old son Vincent Ford was one of the people shot. Brennan Ford, Vincent Ford's brother, called the area a "family block. "Seems like no one was hurt too badly, but that's not what I'm worried about," said Englewood Deputy Chief Leo Schmitz. Ford and another shooting victim were transported to Stroger in serious-to-critical condition, said Meg Ahlheim, a Chicago Fire Department spokeswoman.
