Jefferson Parish sheriff's deputies arrested at least four people in an early Monday morning shooting in Harvey that left five people injured, including three young children and two women, authorities said. Several units responded to the scene at the apartment complex where they found five people had been shot. One of the men was apprehended near the Superdome and three other men were arrested shortly afterwards, Fortunato said. Three of the victims were children under the age of three; the other two adults were women, Fortunato said. Near an off-ramp by the Mercedes Benz-Superdome, the men jumped out of the car and a foot pursuit entailed.
