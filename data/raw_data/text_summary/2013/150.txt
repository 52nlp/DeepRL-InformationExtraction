According to Levy County deputies, 36-year-old Barry Barney of Gainesville died while being airlifted to Shands at the University Florida. One man was shot to death and four other people were wounded Saturday night in Levy County when an unknown assailant opened fire during the Crab Festival, a gathering of about 10,000 people from around the Southeast U.S. on County Road 318, east of Williston. “Eventually, it just got too big for the cul-de-sac and moved out to the main road,” Jones said. But, in all honesty, it's more of a family festival,” Jones said. “We were, at the most, 50 yards away,” Levy County Sheriff Bobby McCallum said Sunday.
