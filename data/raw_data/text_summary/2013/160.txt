HOME | CaribbeanQuadruple-Murder Rekindles Problem of Crime in Puerto RicoSAN JUAN  A quadruple-murder over the weekend raised to 296 the number of violent deaths in Puerto Rico so far this year. The incident has rekindled the subject of crime in the streets of Puerto Rico, where it is more common than ever for multiple killings to be perpetrated in broad daylight. Carlos Cruz, said the quadruple-murder is probably linked to the slaying last Wednesday in Aguas Buenas of another drug suspect. Police said the four deaths in the multiple killing raised last weekends toll of violent deaths to 11 in Puerto Rico, 20 fewer than on the same dates last year. Most of the average of 10 homicides per weekend in Puerto Rico are the result of a settling of scores between gangs for control of drug corners.
