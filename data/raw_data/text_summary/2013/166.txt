EAST PALO ALTO (CBS SF) — Five people were shot and a young girl was injured in East Palo Alto Sunday after gunshots were fired into a crowd of people at a bus stop near a McDonald’s restaurant, according to fire officials. Firefighters arriving on the scene found the victims – four inside the restaurant and two outside, but it is unclear where they were shot, Schapelhouman said. Police said a pair of shooters opened fire on the crowd, but there was no indication yet as to why. There were four Hispanic young males there at the time, a grandmother, and a young granddaughter, approximately, 6-years-old. The little girl was injured, but that was because she fell when she tried to run away,” he said.
