Los Angeles police say an argument that got out of control led to a shooting that killed three men and wounded a fourth. Officers answering 911 calls of eight or nine shots being fired went to an apartment building in the Harbor Gateway area south of downtown shortly after 5:30 a.m. Friday. Rudy Lopez tells KTTV-TV the man was trying to flag down cars to take him away. Lopez says all four men knew each other and the shooting followed a dispute. Police say a fourth man was found about two blocks away with a leg wound.
