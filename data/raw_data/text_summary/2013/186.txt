A suspect has been charged with open murder for the brutal killing spree that resulted in five deaths on Monday and put a small western Nevada town on edge. The open murder charge means Bean can face homicide charges ranging from first degree murder to manslaughter. Lyon County police on Wednesday announced Jeremiah Diaz Bean, 25, who was arrested Monday on burglary charges, now faces the open murder charges along with arson, burglary, robbery, ex-felon in possession of a firearm and grand larceny counts. Police believe Bean broke into the home of Robert Pape, 84, his wife, Dorothy, 84, then killed the couple in their Fernley, Nev. home and stole their car. Police said Bean, who served time for burglary in 2011, also admitted to being a gang member.
