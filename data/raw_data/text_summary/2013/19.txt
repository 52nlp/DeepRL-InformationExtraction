Within minutes of the shooting, officers broadcast a description of the gunman and the car, a red Pontiac, that fled the shooting scene. And at 8:35 p.m., another shooting took place in the 4800 block of Wilson Avenue in eastern New Orleans. Officers shot three of the suspects, killing one man. By nightfall, authorities were still sorting out details of the chaos, which unfurled over a 15-minute span. Two grenades discovered Thursday evening when the red Pontiac involved in the eastern New Orleans shootout was being processed in a "crime cage" at police headquarters.
