As of Friday evening, police had not yet released the names of the six officers who shot Johnson after he fired his weapon. The two other victims who died at the scene were identified as Keishaune Keppard, 20, and Troy Leslie, 37. After the group went to the garage to smoke, Jubbard Price and Johnson opened fire, likely using guns found in the house, police said. Reyland Berry, 60, who also lived in the home, chased after the suspects and shot at them but missed, police said. The trio bailed out of the car, and Johnson began firing at officers with a .380-caliber semi-automatic handgun, police said.
