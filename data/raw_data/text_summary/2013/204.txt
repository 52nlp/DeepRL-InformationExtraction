SAGINAW, MI — Prosecutors have charged four men in connection with the May 23 quadruple shooting in which a Saginaw teenager died. Saginaw police secured arrest warrants against the four men on Monday afternoon, and Frank signed the warrants before arraigning McGee and Clark. The two others, Isaiah D. Clark and Keon V. Bowens, are charged with possessing a firearm during the incident. While two of the men remain jailed on $1 million bonds and two remain at large, none of the four are charged with killing Tonquinisha “NeNe” McKinley's death or with shooting the other three female victims. “These four involved were definitely the four that were there,” said Saginaw Police Sgt.
