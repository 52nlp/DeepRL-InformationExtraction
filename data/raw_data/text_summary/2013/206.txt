Grand jury gets Hampton carnival murder caseWitnesses testify in the case that left 16-year-old death near city carnivalTwo groups of teens were jawing with each other outside the Hampton Coliseum Spring Carnival that Saturday night, when one teen pulled out a handgun. HAMPTON â€” Just before a shooting that killed one teen and wounded four others outside a Hampton carnival in late May, one teenage male dared another to shoot. On Tuesday, Judge Robert Wilson found that prosecutors had established probable cause in the case, certifying the charges and sending them to a grand jury in Circuit Court. But Wilson agreed to close the courtroom based on Bell's assertions, with about 30 spectators having to leave the courtroom. Two teenage girls on hand in the group of teens before the shooting began were the prosecution's two witnesses.
