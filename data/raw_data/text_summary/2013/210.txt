Two people are dead and five injured, including a sheriff, after a gunman in Central Texas opened fire on several vehicles, apparently at random, authorities said. Concho County authorities deferred comment Monday to the DPS office in Austin. The Texas Department of Public Safety said the gunman is among the dead. The suspect fired on the vehicle of Concho County Sheriff Richard Doane when the sheriff came upon him north of Eden, according to DPS. Over the next 90 minutes, he's suspected of shooting two people who were sitting in a car at a convenience store in McCulloch County and then another motorist back in adjacent Concho County.
