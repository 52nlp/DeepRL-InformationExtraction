The daughter of 60-year-old Brenda Norman told Channel 2â€™s Amanda Cook the shooting stemmed from a neighborhood fight that happened five days ago. The shooting happened shortly after midnight at a home on Fair Street, west of the Atlanta University Center. An investigation is underway in southwest Atlanta, where four people, including a 60-year-old woman, were shot. Then the whole neighborhood went crazy. Channel 2 Action News crews saw several officers among the large crowd of people near the home after the shooting.
