It happened about 5:00 p.m. Monday in Englewood near 57th and Sangamon. A short time after they arrived Monday evening, relatives and friends learned April McDaniel,18, died of a gunshot to the chest. Relatives suspect it was a gang member who fired the shots, but they say she was not involved in gangs. Police believe it was the vehicle a gunman was in when he opened fire at a group of young people standing on a porch. Witnesses tell ABC7 that shots rang out from the passenger side of a vehicle driving by slowly as some friends were on a porch enjoying the weather.
