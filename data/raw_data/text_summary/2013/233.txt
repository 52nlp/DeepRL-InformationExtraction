ST. LOUIS • From the 1900 block of Warren Street, where five people were wounded early Tuesday in a wild night of gunfire, downtown’s office towers and the Gateway Arch are within sight. Seventeen people were wounded in seven apparently unrelated shooting incidents, and another man was hurt in an attack involving a knife. It’s too rough a life here.”Not just on the 1900 block of Warren, at least not during a six-hour period late Monday and Tuesday. • Three people were shot shortly before 11 p.m. Monday, in the 700 block of Aubert Avenue: men, 28 and 25, and a woman, 26. “There is no indication that we’re on the same path this year, though last night certainly is very troubling,” Rosenfeld said Tuesday.
