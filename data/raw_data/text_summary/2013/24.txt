Complete coverage of Nehemiah Griego on Crimesider Greg Griego, 51, went on missions to Mexico and conducted prayer sessions with former jail inmates and weekly Bible study gatherings. Sheriff Dan Houston has said investigators have no information that Griego actually went to a Wal-Mart that day. Nehemiah also participated in jam sessions with the Calvary Albuquerque's youth band and pickup basketball games at the church. Friends said Nehemiah's father, a gang member-turned pastor, raised the family in the Christian faith.
