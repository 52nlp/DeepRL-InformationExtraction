BRENTWOOD (CBS SF) — A drive-by shooting that wounded four teenagers in Brentwood on Monday appears to have been gang-related, a police captain said. Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call Brentwood police Detective Aguirre at (925) 809-7726 or Detective Folena at (925) 809-7743. He said that although Brentwood is “not immune” to gang activity, it is rare in the town of about 52,000. Some of the words the suspects used leads us to believe that it could have gang motivated,” Brentwood Police Department Captain Tom Hanson told KCBS. An investigation into the shooting is under way and police are attempting to identify witnesses that might lead them to the suspects.
