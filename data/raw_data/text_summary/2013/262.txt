The officers who shot Faust have been put on administrative leave while the State Bureau of Investigation investigates the shooting. Police did find documents and computers that are helping investigators figure out why Faust started shooting, Aden said. Investigators haven't found any links between Faust and the four victims, Aden said at a news conference. Aden identified the suspect as Lakim Anthony Faust and said the 23-year-old Greenville man will be charged with four counts of attempted first-degree murder when he recovers from gunshot wounds he suffered as police took him into custody Friday. More than 100 rounds of shotgun ammunition were found on Faust after police shot him, Aden said.
