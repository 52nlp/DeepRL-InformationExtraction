The shooting occurred near where the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade had passed some 30 minutes earlier. "It's the state of affairs in our nation that young men do not heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr.," Serpas said. Police said that the shooting occurred shortly after 1 p.m. on the corner of LaSalle Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Authorities said the shooting did not appear to be related to the Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade, which passed by about 30 minutes prior as residents participated in the 27th annual march to King's statue on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Five people were shot, Serpas said.
