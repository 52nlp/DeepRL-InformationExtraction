Kansas City Police Chief Darryl Forte says one of the nine people injured in a shooting early Sunday has died. Officers have spent much of the morning interviewing a large number of witnesses who were at the scene. At least one other person had serious injuries from the shooting. Forte said there were between 250 and 300 people at the club when officers first arrived. Forte had said earlier that a woman was on life support with a gunshot wound to the head.
