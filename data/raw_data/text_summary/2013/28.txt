ST. LOUIS (KMOX) â€“ One person who was shot along with three other men in a drive-by shooting late Friday in North St. Louis has died. It appears the victims were leaving the funeral of man who was a victim of an earlier homicide when someone in an S.U.V. Police continue to look for suspects and think the shootings were in retaliation for the shooting death of a man last week. His funeral was earlier today. That person was shot in the head and later died.
