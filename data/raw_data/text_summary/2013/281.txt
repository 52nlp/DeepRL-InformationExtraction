Tierra Fallin, 29, was charged with first- and second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the shooting, which left Gennie Shird, 21, of Baltimore dead and three other women wounded. Baltimore police have charged a woman with murder in the fatal shooting of her neighbor last month during a spate of violence that left 12 people dead in a single week. Fallin was charged with 21 criminal counts, including one count of first-degree murder, two of attempted first-degree murder, three of attempted first-degree conspiracy to commit murder and three of reckless endangerment. Police, who tweeted news of the arrest Thursday, said they are withholding the names of the witnesses for their protection. Fallin went to her grandmother's home and returned minutes later with two unidentified men about 9:07 p.m., witnesses said.
