Police say earlier, there was an altercation in the parking lot outside before gun shots rang out. "When the two men refused, investigators say Stinson and the other men proceeded to punch and strike one victim. About that time, investigators say Horry fled to the parking lot to retrieve a pistol from under the seat of his motorcycle. Even with the door shut I could still hear gun shots outside and screaming and yelling. The parking lot near Cycle Gear was filled with onlookers of a triple murder scene Saturday afternoon.
