Springfield officers were dispatched to the Nite Owl Tavern, 601 West Main St., around 11:55 p.m. after receiving calls related to the shooting. Just before midnight police and medics were called to the Night Owl Bar at 601 W. Main St. for a fight. Springfield Police Chief Steve Moody said that when officers arrived on the scene, they found a gunshot victim inside the bar. The Nite Owl Tavern has been on the Springfield Police Division’s list of bars with the highest number of calls for service. In July 2000, a Springfield police officer was shot and seriously injured in the tavern’s parking lot during a traffic stop.
