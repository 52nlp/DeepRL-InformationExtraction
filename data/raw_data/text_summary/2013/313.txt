The shooting, which the police said appeared to be an outburst of gang violence, occurred while the teenagers stood together in front of 472 Marcy Avenue. Police officials said the violence appeared to be linked to a rivalry between gangs from rival housing complexes. Such battles between teenagers, which the police say are often over territory and respect, account for many of the cityâ€™s shootings. The shooting killed Mario Lopez, 18, and left a 13-year-old boy, who was shot in the neck, critically wounded.
