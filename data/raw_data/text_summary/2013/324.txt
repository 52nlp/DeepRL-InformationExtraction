Six people shot, one killed, in Baltimore on TuesdayDeputy Commissioner Dean Palmere told reporters at the scene that police were "making progress" in the investigation, but said detectives need the public to help them. That presence remained as other units responded to the shooting scene, and Palmere said detectives were comparing the quadruple shooting to other recent incidents. The man who was killed fell at the nearby street corner outside an abandoned red-brick corner store. About 12 hours earlier, two men were shot in East Baltimore's Broadway East neighborhood, roughly six blocks from where a new peace mural had been unveiled the day before. Police said a preliminary investigation revealed an unknown person came onto the 1800 block of E. Lanvale St. and shot multiple times at the victims.
