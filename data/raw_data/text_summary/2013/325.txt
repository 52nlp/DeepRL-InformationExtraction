Photo by: wbaltv.com((See Update))Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake will attend a public safety walk tonight in the Belair-Edison section of Northeast Baltimore as a new wave of shootings struck the city today. Last week, she led a safety walk through the McElderry Park neighborhood in East Baltimore, near a quadruple shooting that left 18-year-old Donyae Jones dead. The double shooting took place around 2:30 this morning in the 1800 block of East Lanvale Street, police said. The spike in violence began on Friday, June 22, when the mayor was attending a five-day conference of mayors in Las Vegas.
