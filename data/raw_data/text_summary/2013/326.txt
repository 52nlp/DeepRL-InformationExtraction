That shooting happened Thursday; all four people were shot in front of a home on North Carrollton Avenue. On Tuesday the police commissioner announced the department had a man in custody in connection with a quadruple shooting last week in West Baltimore. He already faces murder charges in a triple shooting that happened in June, on Elmora Avenue in Northeast Baltimore. Three days later, investigators say Anderson broke into a home on Moore's Run Court, and shot a man during the course of a robbery. Police say Jones and another man were dressed in construction vests and hats when they pulled out a handgun and started shooting.
