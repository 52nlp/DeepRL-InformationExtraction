Batts told reporters that police recently received tips that the Black Guerilla Family is trying to move into Harlem Park. “I will be out here and we will root out the problems that are impacting the young kids and their safety in their neighborhoods,” Batts pledged. “Lamont tried to take the lives of citizens on our block.”The brazen daytime shooting shook local residents. Batts said the shooting is indicative of the violence sweeping the western district of the city. On the day of the shooting, resident Yvette Sarabia, who moved to the neighborhood three months ago, told the AFRO she doesn’t feel safe.
