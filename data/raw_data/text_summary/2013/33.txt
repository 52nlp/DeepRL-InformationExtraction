PHOENIX (AP) â€” A lawyer wounded by a gunman in a Phoenix office shooting this week has become the second victim to die in the attack, authorities said Friday. Hummels worked with the Phoenix law firm Osborn Maledon and focused on business disputes, real estate litigation and malpractice defense. Police said Friday that they recovered two pistols believed used in the office shooting from Harmon's rental car along with an AR-15 rifle. Hummels died Thursday night, a publicist for his law firm told The Associated Press early Friday. Mark Hummels, 43, had been on life support at a Phoenix hospital after Wednesday morning's shooting that killed a company's chief executive and left a woman with non-life threatening injuries.
