Nasir says people who were at the party told him the ones that came up shooting were not invited guests. And I guess three people came in from another outlaw gang or something and just started shooting,” said Waqar Nasir. Three others were injured including 22-year-old Aaron Wayne Brown, 41-year-old Joe Brown and 33-year-old Michael Hogue. Investigators say the gunfire was exchanged between many of the victims and no arrests have been made in the case.
