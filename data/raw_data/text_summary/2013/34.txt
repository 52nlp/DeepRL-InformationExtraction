Campbell's friend, a 17-year-old Oakland boy, was also shot, police said, as were a 24-year-old Oakland woman and a 29-year-old San Francisco woman. "We've done everything we could to try to ensure a peaceful event," Arnold said. The shooting happened as the crowded event was winding down and left attendees and organizers wondering about its future. "It's really unfortunate because this event is something that really spotlights the positivity of Oakland. "The shooting "brings things to a head" for organizers, Arnold said.
