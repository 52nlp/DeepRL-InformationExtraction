OAKLAND -- Two suspected gang members have been charged with murder in the shooting death of an 8-year-old girl killed while answering the front door during a sleepover in July, authorities said Tuesday. Nuno, Connors, Roos and Wilson were arrested Saturday after police served search warrants in Berkeley, Oakland and Hayward. Williams and Carroll were each charged with murder, three counts of attempted murder and shooting at an inhabited dwelling. Prosecutors will decide whether to seek the death penalty against Williams, who was embarking on a brutal crime spree when he killed the girl, investigators said. Williams was shooting dice with Medearis and others when he decided to rob Medearis, according to court papers.
