The shooting happened Friday morning near Yosemite Avenue and Cleveland in Madera. Four people were injured and one was left in critical condition after someone opened fire on the car they were riding in. The shooting happened just before 10 a.m. Friday, near an apartment complex and shopping center. For several hours, while crime scene processors collected evidence, incoming patients were diverted to another entrance while detectives looked for clues. "We've canvassed the area for witnesses, video and other evidence, and it's an ongoing investigation at this time," Smith said.
