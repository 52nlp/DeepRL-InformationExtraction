This took place at about 1:50 a.m., and police said Holden was shot multiple times, and found unresponsive at the scene. A 40-year-old man was shot multiple times. But the 28-year-old Altgeld Gardens man’s life ended in a flurry of violence this past weekend. Johnson said she’s known the Holden all her life, and has three children with him; a 6-year-old daughter and 2-year-old twins. Jeanette Johnson, 34, said she was near the 600 block of E. 131st Street early Sunday morning when a fight broke out between Holden and another man.
