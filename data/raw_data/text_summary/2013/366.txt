A gunman opened fire in a Brooklyn park yesterday in a senseless act of revenge — wounding five people, including two bystanders sitting on a porch, witnesses and officials said. Amil’s sister, Lisa, was in a nearby park watching her son, Hector, 8, play with his Little League baseball team. Wanda Espinoza, 52, was shot in the stomach as she sat outside her house. The shooter was at large, but witnesses said cops did nab a unidentified man when he returned to the scene to retrieve the discarded gun. He was angry at the thug for harassing his daughter at a McDonald’s where she works, his family said.
