The Swigers apparently got in the way as Muller was trying to flee and also were shot, Shaffer said. Shaffer said Muller went to the well-known drug house for a drug deal that apparently went bad. He said one of the initial victims -- either Hart or Amos -- was shot inside the house and another was shot outside. Shaffer said Fred and Freddy Swiger were delivering newspapers for The Exponent-Telegram when they were gunned down. Clarksburg detectives went to Marion County to interview Muller, and later charged him with murder.
