Harrison County Prosecuting Attorney Jack Shaffer said investigators believe a drug deal went wrong around 4:30 a.m. Friday in a neighborhood known for drug activity. "The scale of the crime is highly unusual for Clarksburg, said Shaffer, a lifelong county resident and its elected prosecutor for 11 years. The Exponent Telegram reports that the bystanders were Fred and Freddy Swiger, a father and son who had contracted to deliver the Clarksburg newspaper for about 30 years. Shaffer also declined to identify any of the victims, but said two had nothing to do with the suspected drug deal. "They were extremely nice, loyal, and cared very deeply about their customers, said Exponent-Telegram President Brian Jarvis.
