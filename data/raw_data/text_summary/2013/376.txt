CHARLESTON, W.Va., July 27 (UPI) -- West Virginia police said four people were gunned down in Charlestown after what appeared to be a drug deal gone awry. "I only had the pleasure of knowing Fred and Freddy for the past year and a half, since I took over ownership of The Exponent-Telegram," Jarvis said. It wasn't immediately clear what prompted Muller to allegedly open fire on the men. Muller was inside a noted drug house about 4:30 a.m. Friday when he allegedly gunned down two men, Todd Russell Amos, 29, and Christopher A. Hart, 26. Two of the victims were delivering newspapers in the neighborhood early Friday and police said they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time," the Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette reported.
