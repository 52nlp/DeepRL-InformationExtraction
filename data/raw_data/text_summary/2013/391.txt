× Man claims self-defense after four shot in Broad RippleINDIANAPOLIS, Ind.– Four people are recovering from gunshot wounds after a shooter sprayed bullets into a large crowd on College Avenue early Friday morning. Witnesses told Fox59 they heard a man claiming he had been punched in the face just before the shots started. Investigators said they found four people suffering from gunshot wounds on the sidewalk on Broad Ripple Avenue in front of The Wild Beaver Saloon. He said he’d done it all in self-defense because the people he shot were trying to attack him and had already attacked one of his friends. According to the police report, the shooter waved down an officer and told him he pulled the trigger.
