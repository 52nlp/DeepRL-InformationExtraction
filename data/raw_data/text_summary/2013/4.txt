MCKEESPORT (KDKA) – Allegheny County Police say they have issued an arrest warrant for the suspected gunman in an overnight shooting during a New Year’s Eve party in McKeesport. For most of New Year’s Eve evening, Gabriel Patterson’s Versailles Avenue house party was the place to be for about 140 people. “I’d never been in a situation like that in my life.”Groggy from sleep, Patterson woke up quick with terrible images and fear now filling his mind. Sims is also wanted on a previously existing warrant for firearms violations, police said. “It’s not going to be pretty.”Anyone with information on Sims’ whereabouts is asked to contact the Allegheny County Police Homicide Unit at 412-473-3000.
