A gunman barged into a municipal meeting in Pennsylvania last night and went on a shooting spree, killing three people and wounding two others. The Pocono Record reported that authorities later descended on the property of Rockne Newell, a local hoarder who has been cited for numerous violations. The gunman, who appeared to be shooting randomly, was being treated at a hospital last night and was in police custody. Among the complaints were the massive amounts of junk that Newell kept on his property, including buckets of human waste. After battling with the township for almost 20 years, Newell was ordered to vacate his property last August, the paper said.
