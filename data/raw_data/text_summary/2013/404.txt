Man pleads not guilty in Ross Township shooting rampage'I need glasses and a hearing aid and medical attention,' Rockne Newell tells Monroe County judge. Police say Newell shot and killed Gerard Kozic, 53, of Saylorsburg, when Kozic dived in front of his wife to take the bullets. Although police say Newell has admitted committing the shooting, Newell's attorney, William Ruzzo, said Newell is pleading not guilty "at this time. The last time Rockne Newell appeared before a judge, he seemed disinterested, even as an audio recording of his alleged shooting rampage at a Ross Township meeting filled the courtroom. Newell said little, other than to comment when the judge asked if Newell could see and hear him.
