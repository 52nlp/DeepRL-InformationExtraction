A gunman is on the loose and a manhunt under way after four people were shot in Montclair early Tuesday morning. The victims, an 18-year-old girl and three men in their 20s, were shot outside a house on Mission Street just after 1 a.m. They were running down the street, apparently in an effot to escape the gunman, when they were shot. Tuesday night, the mayor held a meeting and vowed to boost the police presence in Montclair. The gunman, described as a man with his face covered, fled on foot.
