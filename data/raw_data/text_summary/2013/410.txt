Bradford was the one victim who knew Jenkins, according to the World-Herald. Nikko Jenkins, 26, made "incriminating statements" about the shooting spree to investigators, according to the World-Herald. All but one of the victims had no connection to Jenkins, the World-Herald reported. Police believe Jenkins then pulled her out of her car and shot her in the head, according to WOWT. That's just half the 21-year sentence he got for two carjackings and the assaults that happened when he was in prison, according to the World-Herald.
