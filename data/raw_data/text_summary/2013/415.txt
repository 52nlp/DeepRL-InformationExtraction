The man accused of killing four of his family members went before a judge on Monday. According to court papers, Green is accused of shooting and killing his mother, Sallie Cizek, his sister Rebecca Cizek, and her two children, 17-year-old Katherine Cizek and 6-month-old Amario Dominguez. Daniel Green is behind bars at the Oklahoma County jail, where he is being held without bond on four counts of first degree murder. Court papers state Green told police he was trying to get away from his family members because they were stopping him from being with his one true love in California. She says the murder happened the day after her birthday and she had just moved to Kentucky for college.
