The officer wrote that Green told him he was on his way to California to be with his true love. He remains in the Oklahoma County jail; bail has been denied. Oklahoma County prosecutors filed four counts of first-degree murder against Daniel Livingston Green. An Oklahoma City man who told police he had to get away from his family because they were preventing him from being with his one true love was charged Tuesday with killing four of them, including his mother and infant nephew. He told police he could have “emptied a magazine on them,” according to an affidavit signed by a police officer and filed in Oklahoma County District Court.
