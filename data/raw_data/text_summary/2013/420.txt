"You hear a pop, pop. Police are checking several surveillance cameras on Telegraph Avenue near 17th and 18th streets, hoping it will lead to the gunman. The trouble began a little after 4:00 p.m. when somebody broke into a car on Telegraph Avenue and grabbed a purse. The shooting took place in Uptown Oakland in the shadow of the Fox Theater and trendy eateries. "They were just lying there in pools of blood, just doing my best to hold his wounds," Oakland business woman Nenna Joiner said.
