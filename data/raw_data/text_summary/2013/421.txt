"He's one of the people that really need to be kept behind bars for good," said Dwayne McCarther, a part owner of the hair salon.

OAKLAND -- A 20-year-old Oakland man has been arrested and charged in the Saturday afternoon shooting of four people outside an Uptown District hair salon after his attempt to steal a purse from a hair stylist's car was foiled, police said Monday. Fair, who was shot in the calf, returned to the hair salon Monday and plans to go back to work as soon as possible. The woman's boyfriend and some others chased Ward down and got back her purse, but Ward got away, authorities said.
