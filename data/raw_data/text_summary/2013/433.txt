Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett noted there’s much more to the Safe Passage routes than simply placing yellow signs designating certain streets as part of the program. “Safe Passage is not just the geographic passage where children walk, it’s a comprehensive strategy … involving multiple resources of the sister agencies,” she said. The other shooting on a Safe Passage route happened in Bronzeville on Aug. 11, when one man was killed and another was wounded in the 2900 block of South State Street. Allen said pools of blood and the wounded victims lay just outside the church doors after the shooting. Uptown Baptist Church Pastor Michael Allen said he heard the shooting was the result of one gang placing a hit on a rival gang member.
