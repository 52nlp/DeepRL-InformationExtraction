Seven people were shot, including a 15-year-old fatally shot in the in the head, at what police say was an illegal dice game in west Baltimore Saturday night. Commissioner Batts said there is no known motive, but noted dice game violence is typically connected to a robbery. "Seven people shot in a cluster is outrageous for the city and unacceptable for the us as a whole," said Batts. When officers arrived they found a 15-year-old boy shot in the head. Another six men were shot and are expected to live, according to police spokesman Det.
