LAKE BUTLER | A longtime employee of a Florida trucking company was once very close with his former boss, even known as his right-hand man. He shot and killed former co-worker Rolando Gonzalez-Delgado, 28, around 9 a.m., then went a short distance and killed Pritchett, 80, who founded the company in 1980. Allen killed himself at his nearby home. Allen then went to the company’s headquarters in Lake Butler and shot 44-year-old David Griffis in the stomach, the sheriff’s office said. It was clear to everyone in town that Allen and Pritchett had a good relationship at one point.
