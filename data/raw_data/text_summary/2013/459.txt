Investigators say four people have been found shot to death in a car near a former Tennessee mountain resort. The Renegade Mountain Resort was built in 1969 as part of a gated community. State Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Kristin Helm says the car was found near an abandoned guard shack Thursday at a resort community about 50 miles west of Knoxville. Homeowners association President John Moore says a resident found the bodies on the way to work. The car was about 100 feet off a main road.
