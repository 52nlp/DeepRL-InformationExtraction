Authorities found four victims, three of which were teens in a car near the Renegade Mountain development. The grand jury indictment charged Bennett with four counts of premeditated murder, four counts of felony murder and two counts of attempted aggravated robbery. The two robbery counts stem from Bennett and Moser attempting to rob Jacobson and Davis during a marijuana exchange, according to authorities. Authorities said Moser, who is Bennett's girlfriend, was with Bennett at the time of the murders.
