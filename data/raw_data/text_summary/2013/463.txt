Three men were shot at the Centreville public housing complex at about 2:20 a.m. Friday. CENTREVILLE â€¢ Schoolchildren going to their bus stop this morning walked past police evidence markers and a blood trail outside the Ernest Smith apartments. It was the latest violence to erupt at the complex since a Centreville police lieutenant was murdered while on patrol there in 2009. One group left, but returned about an hour later and opened fire outside the apartment complex, police say. He said there are several crime scenes, and a blood trail extended from one to the next as the victims scattered and tried to get help.
