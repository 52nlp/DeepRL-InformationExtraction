Under Secretary for the Navy, Juan Garcia, said Navy Yard would reopen tomorrow for essential personnel only. Both Gray and Lanier said the streets around the Navy Yard would be opened by about 5:30 a.m. Tuesday. At least 13 people are dead and others wounded after a shooter opened fire at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday, police said. Lanier lifted the shelter in place order for the neighborhood around the Navy Yard that had been in place for much of the day. Adm. Jonathan W. Greenert, the chief of Naval Operations, was evacuated from his residence at the Navy Yard complex shortly after the first report of shots fired, Navy officials said.
