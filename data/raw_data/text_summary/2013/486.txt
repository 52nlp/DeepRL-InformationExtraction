At least 16 bullets were fired into Cornell Square Park around 10:15 p.m. on Thursday, wounding a 3-year-old boy and a dozen other people. Deonta, who was standing near the court, was shot near the ear and the bullet exited through his cheek, according to police and relatives. The 13 people hit included both the pick-up gameâ€™s players and spectators such as 3-year-old Deonta Howard. About 60 police officers converged on the park and crime lab investigators combed the scene. Another victim, a 37-year-old man who was shot in the leg, said he had been hanging around the park with friends when the gunfire began.
