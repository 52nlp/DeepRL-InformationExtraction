Vazquez family friend Gustavo Herrera said the mother hadnâ€™t been her usual happy, family-oriented self. A mother fatally shot her husband and three sons in their Navarro County home before killing herself with a single shot in the head last week, the sheriff announced Tuesday. The killings came less than two weeks after Alvarez was arrested Sept. 11 on a family violence charge. About six months ago in Mesquite, Angelica Vazquez fatally shot her two adult children and her husband before killing herself. Records show Alvarez pleaded no contest to family violence assault, a misdemeanor, and paid a $367 fine and was released after spending two days in jail.
