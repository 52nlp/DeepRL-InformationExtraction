Police said Mr. Frew then turned and saw Mr. Ruckinger crouched against the home's refrigerator, firing a handgun at him. After the shooting stopped, Mr. Frew called 911 and went outside to wait for the police on the front porch. At the time, Mr. Ruckinger was carrying a .410 derringer pistol and a .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol, according to state police. The elder Mr. Frew, however, escaped injury and managed to retrieve a .22-caliber revolver from a rear bedroom, they said. Mr. Frew shot back, striking the male intruder, including at least once in the head, and killing him.
