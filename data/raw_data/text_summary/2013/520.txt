Steve Odom said a gun was recovered but that it will have to be tested to see if it is linked to the Saturday night shooting. Two men have been taken into custody and face multiple charges in the shooting of five people at Saturday’s festival, authorities said Sunday. “And I know a lot of other people will not come (to the Oct. 26-27 event) because of that,” she said. Hmong are an Asian ethnic group mainly from Laos and number between 3,000 and 4,000 in Tulsa. “They really don’t have common Hmong names, either,” she said.
