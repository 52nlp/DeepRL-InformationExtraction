HARRISBURG - Harrisburg police are investigating a shooting outside a city community center that sent multiple people to the hospital this weekend. Detectives later determined that a fight began at a youth party inside the Allison Hill Community Center, and as kids were leaving the building, someone began shooting into the crowd. It happened just after midnight Sunday near the intersection of North 16th and Walnut streets. At that time, police dispatchers began taking reports that multiple people began arriving at local hospitals with non-life threatening gunshot wounds. Officers responded for a report of one person shot, but when they arrived, they were directed to the area of Walnut and Hoerner streets for a report of shots fired.
