A plaque visible inside shows that the Reed-Moore Central Allison Hill Community Center opened in January 1989 with funds donated by John Vartan. Shalee Aleman remembers when the Allison Hill Community Center at 1524 Walnut St. was a place where kids could go after school for homework help or for summer programs. “This community deserves as good services as any other community,” Diallo said. The community center was closed Monday morning. City officials have not yet responded to a request for information on who now operates the center and who was hosting the party Saturday.
