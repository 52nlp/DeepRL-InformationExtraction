MIAMI GARDENS (CBS4) – As Saturday night got underway, Miami Gardens police swarmed a residential neighborhood off of NW 187 Street and 30 Avenue. The anonymous neighbor, who is the mother of a 14 year old boy, said, “I’m afraid for him. Police said an unknown man walked up to a home where the four victims were sitting on a porch, started shooting, then ran off. They cut access in and out for several blocks in that area after a gunman opened fire on four men, ages 19-23. One woman who lives a block away from the shooting told CBS 4 News she is frustrated and frightened because gun violence is increasing in the city she’s lived in for 20 years.
