Mayor John DeStefano Jr. said, in his 20 years as mayor, he has never seen such a high percentage of club-related homicides. The Key Club Cabaret’s website says it is Connecticut’s largest after-hours club Friday and Saturday, and Connecticut’s hottest club. Police said that they were told the owners of the club, John Bertini and Peter Forchetti, were not on the property during the shootings. A 19-year-old woman, Amanda John of Asylum Street in New Haven, was also among the victims of the shooting. “As a former mayor myself for 14 years, I absolutely agree with almost everything the mayor has said,” Malloy said.
