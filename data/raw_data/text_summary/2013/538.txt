Pruitt said a third victim found earlier in the morning with multiple gunshots wounds inside a Ridgecrest home also would survive. The two victims underwent surgery after they were airlifted to a hospital and would most likely survive, said Kern County sheriff's spokesman Ray Pruitt. Three people wounded in a shooting spree that stretched from a Ridgecrest home to the middle of a desert highway are likely to survive, authorities say. Seven officers with the Sheriffâ€™s Department, Ridgecrest police and California Highway Patrol fired their weapons, killing the man, he said. Officers saw the man and woman inside.
