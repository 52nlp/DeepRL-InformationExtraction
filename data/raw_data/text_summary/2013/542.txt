Alex Dobuzinskis, Reuters Oct 27, 2013A gunman killed four members of a family and their two dogs and then shot himself to death at a Phoenix apartment complex on Saturday, police said. Officers responded to an emergency call reporting shots fired around 9:15 a.m. local time, said Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Tommy Thompson. When a witness reported seeing someone enter one of the residences, police sought to clear the neighboring unit and entered through the back patio, Thompson said. They found a man whose apartment was damaged by gunfire but who was not wounded. After police discovered the bodies, a special weapons and tactics team entered the neighboring apartment and found the suspected gunman, a man in his 50s, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Thompson said.
