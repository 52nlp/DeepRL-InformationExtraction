Michael Dante Guzzo shattered the peaceful neighbourhood when he shot dead his next-door neighbours Bruce Moore, 66; his daughter, Renee, 36; her husband, Michael, 42 and their son, Shannon, 17. "He didn't want noise," Lopez told the Phoenix Times. According to media reports Renee Moore ran a dog grooming business. Denise Lopez, a neighbour of the killer, said Guzzo had previously argued with pet owners about barking dogs and left notes complaining about the noise. Libni DeLeon, the owner of the dogs, said Guzzo banged and kicked on the front door.
