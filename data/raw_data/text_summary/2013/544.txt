According to police, the four victims were Bruce Moore, 66, Michael Moore, 42, Renee Moore, 36, and Shannon Moore, 17. Guzzo's dead body was found by the Phoenix SWAT team in his townhouse, which is directly next door to where the victims were discovered. According to Sergeant Tommy Thompson, Guzzo may have been angered at the family's barking dogs, but the exact cause of the shooting rampage is still unclear. The suspected shooter was identified as 56-year-old Michael Dante Guzzo. A witness told police they saw Guzzo entering the neighboring unit where the SWAT team found his body with the pump-action shotgun next to it.
