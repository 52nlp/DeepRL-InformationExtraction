Vallejo police are searching for a gunman who shot into a group of young adults changing a tire, killing one man and wounding as many as seven others. When one car hit a curb and got a flat tire near the 200 block of Princeton Ave., the whole group pulled to the curb. Anyone with information about the crime is asked to contact Vallejo police at (800) 488-9383. A neighbor warned the people they were in a bad area, and then heard shooting. Police say there appeared to be only one gunman inside the vehicle -- a white SUV with tinted windows.
