Two police officers and a sheriff’s deputy were shot and wounded in a shootout and chase in Albuquerque, New Mexico Saturday morning. “Two Albuquerque Police Officers and one Bernalillo County Sheriff Deputy currently remain hospitalized at local area hospitals,” Albuquerque Police Chief Allen Banks said in a statement. The newspaper said the man stole the police vehicle belonging to the responding officers, prompting a large police pursuit. Carlos Correa, a tire technician, told The Albuquerque Journal that he and coworkers fled inside their shop and locked the doors after the suspect opened fire on officers responding to call. The suspect, who fired at cops throughout the incident, was pronounced dead after the pursuit ended, police said.
