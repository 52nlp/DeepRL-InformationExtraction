"Law enforcement officials said the survivor called 911 shortly after midnight and reported the shooting at the three-story apartment building on Maujer Street. It wasn't immediately clear why Rafie opened fire on members of another band, although musicians in both groups knew each other and some lived in the same building, Salehezadeh said. Police said the 29-year-old gunman, Ali Akbar Mohammed Rafie, was upset because he had been kicked out of another band, the Free Keys, last year. The third man killed, 35-year-old Ali Eskandarian, was a musician from Iran but was not in the band, according to Salehezadeh. Rafie put the clip back in the rifle, went back to the roof and shot himself in the head.
