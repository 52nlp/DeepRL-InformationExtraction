A house party in far southwest Houston ended in gunfire overnight, leaving one person dead and at least three others hurt. THE POLICE CHIEF'S ADVICEHouston's police chief is speaking plainly to parents in this city after this latest house party shooting. According to the Houston Police Department, the trouble started around midnight during a large house party at a home in the 4400 block of Tiffany at Castlereagh. "You should not turn your house over to teens to have a party," HPD Chief Charles McClelland said. At some point, a couple of cars reportedly drove by the party and there was a disagreement of some sort.
