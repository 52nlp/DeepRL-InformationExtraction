All three of the victims were shot in the head, and were each shot multiple times. The shooting happened Wednesday afternoon at a studio apartment in the 8200 block of Sunbury in the Copperfield area. "Like the first 2 shots, it sounded like loud knocking; then I knew after the third one, it was gunshots.
