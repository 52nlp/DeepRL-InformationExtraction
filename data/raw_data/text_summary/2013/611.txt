Four people were shot in Wilmington, Del., early Saturday as gunfire erupted after an event hosted by Philly rapper Meek Mill. Police said all four victims suffered non-life-threatening injuries. After officers wrested the melee under control, they found three men - aged 21, 22, and 24 - and one woman, 33, had been shot. Paramedics rushed two victims to local hospitals, while two people were driven by friends to area emergency rooms. Troopers shortly before 2 a.m. responded to the parking lot of MoodSwing Nightclub Lounge, located in the 3400 block of Kirkwood Highway.
