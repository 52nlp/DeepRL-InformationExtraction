Meanwhile, Davis said, patrol officers searched the apartment and found three women dead from gunshot wounds. The medical examiner on Sunday determined that Lynn's death was a suicide and that Brittany Mills, Kamesha Mills, and Benson were homicide victims. Brittany Mills had multiple gunshot wounds to the head; Kamesha Mills and Benson had single gunshot wounds to the head. At 9:40 p.m., Manchester police received reports of multiple gunshots at 190 Pine St. in the Dye House apartments. After a confrontation with officers, "it appears [the suspect] put the child on the ground before shooting himself,'' Davis said.
