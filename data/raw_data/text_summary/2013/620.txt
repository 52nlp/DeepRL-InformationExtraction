Witnesses on the scene told officers there were three fights at the birthday party in a short period of time, the first of which they say was quickly broken up. Witnesses told authorities the suspect may have fled the scene in a red or burgundy Nissan passenger car. Iredell County Sheriff's Deputies and officers from the Statesville Police Department responded to the American Legion Post on Wallace Springs Road in Statesville on Saturday to find four teen-aged victims suffering from gunshot wounds. Deputies say while security and bystanders worked to break up the chair fight inside, multiple shots were fired outside.
