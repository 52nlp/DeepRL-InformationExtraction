Authorities say they don't know what started gunfire that left five teenagers shot in east Harris County. One neighbor, Brenda Johnson, says she's worried for her safety and wants to move out of the complex. Sheriff's spokesman Deputy Thomas Gilliland tells KHOU that authorities were trying to figure out if the shooting in Channelview involved more than one group of people. He was airlifted to Memorial Hermann Hospital and reported in stable condition Sunday evening. Sheriff's deputies found one of the five lying on a front lawn.
