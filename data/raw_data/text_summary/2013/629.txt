They were rushed to Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center in East Patchogue with non-life-threatening wounds, cops said. A Suffolk County teen was killed and three others injured early Christmas morning when three masked men burst into an auto repair shop in Medford and demanded money from the victims before opening fire, Suffolk cops said. Suffolk cops would not comment if the robbers made off with any money or valuables. The assailants opened fire on the group of three men and a female and fatally struck Taliek Bristel, 19, who was found dead at the scene. The female was hit in the abdomen and the other two male victims were both shot in the back, officials said.
