Four people were shot, one fatally, overnight Friday in three incidents within a 10-block area of the city’s Bailey-East Delavan neighborhood. “He had a single gunshot wound to his thigh area, and he succumbed to his injury,” Buffalo Chief of Detectives Dennis J. Richards said. At about 12:30 a.m. Saturday, Tevin Sapp and Seth McMorris were struck in a drive-by shooting in the Bailey-Schreck area. He crashed into another vehicle at Newburgh and East Delavan avenues, about two blocks from the shooting scene. A 22-year-old man who was shot drove a couple of blocks before crashing his vehicle.
