-- When the crime barricade tape was removed from the Olde Towne Slidell block, evidence of the tragedy that took place 12 hours before became more clear. Police believe Scott was the person the shooter was aiming for, and everyone else was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Two died 23-year-old Mark Womack and 22-year-old Errol Scott, known as 'Ro' to family and friends. 'Friends tell Eyewitness News that Womack was a great guy who was very involved in his fraternity at Southeastern. 'We have identified potential suspects in this case,' said Slidell Police Chief Randy Smith.
