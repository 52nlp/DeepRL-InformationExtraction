Slidell police have confirmed that one person was killed outside an Olde Towne Slidell bar during a shooting early Thursday. Closing time for bars in Slidell is 2 a.m., said Slidell City Councilman Lionel Hicks, whose council district includes the Olde Towne area. The others were taken to Ocshner Medical Center in Slidell, Slidell Memorial Hospital and to Interim LSU Public Hospital in New Orleans, Seuzeneau said. She said she does not hear a lot of complaints from constituents about the bars in Olde Towne. Councilwoman Kim Harbison, whose at large district also includes Olde Towne, echoed that.
