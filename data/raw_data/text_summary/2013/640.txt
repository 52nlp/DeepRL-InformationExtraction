Police were looking for a suspect or suspects in the gunfire, which erupted just after midnight at a building in the Howard Houses public housing complex in Brownsville. "Brownsville has one the city's highest concentrations of public housing developments. Five men heading to a party in Brooklyn were shot and a woman apparently was pistol-whipped, police and a community advocate said Tuesday, marking a year-end outburst of violence in a neighborhood that has struggled with crime even as it hit record lows. In Brownsville, major crime hasn't declined as steeply as it has in some other parts of the city in the last 12 years. The woman was in "excruciating pain," said Herbert, who didn't have the full names of those injured.
