Police in Fontana are investigating the shooting deaths of four family members, including two children, who were found inside their home by a relative Monday night as a possible murder-suicide. The relative, who hadn't heard from the family, made the grisly discovery about 8:30 p.m. after going to the home, said Martha Guzman-Hurtado, a Fontana police spokeswoman. The woman and the children each had multiple gunshot wounds, authorities said, and the man had a single gunshot wound to the head. Antonio Elliott, 48, raised his four children here, moving to the neighborhood 14 years ago from Compton. It reminded him of his own loss: His son, his namesake, was killed in a violent motorcycle accident over the summer.
