Officers made contact with Salameh and a female victim, and ``gunshots were exchanged between officers and Salameh,'' who was killed at the scene, he said. North Liberty is a fast-growing city of about 13,000 just north of Iowa City, and many university employees live there. IOWA CITY, Iowa â€” A bright but troubled University of Iowa graduate student exchanged gunfire with police officers responding to a domestic disturbance, a shootout that left him dead and three officers injured, a sheriff said Monday. Three North Liberty police officers were struck by gunfire and transported to University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics for care. Ghamari said Salameh had long lived in the Iowa City area, and he earned an undergraduate degree at the university.
