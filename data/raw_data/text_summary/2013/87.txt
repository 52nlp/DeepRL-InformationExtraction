ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - St. Petersburg Police said they now have a solid idea of what led up to a drive-by shootout early Wednesday morning. St. Pete police said the limo driver flagged them down around 4 a.m. at Queensboro and 31st Street, as they were working an unrelated case. He pointed out the limo driver made a personal choice in carrying a gun. Police recovered the black Chrysler and said they found one man shot inside. "We're thinking somebody saw this and were thinking they'd be good robbery targets," said St. Pete Police spokesperson Mike Puetz.
