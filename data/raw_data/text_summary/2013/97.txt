Two men running for their lives ducking sparks, smoke and chunks of debris as a suspect with a high-powered AK-47 fired wildly at them. Police are looking for a suspect who they say used an AK-47 in two separate shootings that left one person dead and three wounded. A few days earlier on April 6th, two men were walking down the street at 7th and Venango streets when police say the same man armed with the same AK-47 fired wildly at them. Meanwhile a $30,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible. "He starts firing at them, but then as he's running away, he's just firing in the air so he's a very dangerous person," said Capt.
