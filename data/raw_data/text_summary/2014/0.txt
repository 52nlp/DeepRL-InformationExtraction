But he never signed a deal with the G-Unit record label, a representative for 50 Cent said on Friday. Mr. Green was paroled on Dec. 20 after serving about two and a half years in prison for assault, according to state records. Gabriela Gilmore, 24, a teacher’s assistant who lives in the area, said that “everyone in the neighborhood knew” Mr. Green. The man shot in the leg was taken to North Shore Long Island Jewish Hospital, while the other survivors were taken to Jamaica Medical Center.
