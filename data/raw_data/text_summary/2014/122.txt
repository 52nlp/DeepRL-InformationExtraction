A 28-year-old man shot and killed three members of a southern California family before turning the gun on himself, authorities said Friday. Officers went to the house after the man called relatives of the victims and said he was going to harm the family, police said. The suspect was found at the foot of the younger woman's bed. The suspect lived at the home, and the crime appears to have stemmed from a domestic situation, Keltner said. A woman in her 50s and her 24-year-old daughter and 17-year-old son were killed in their respective bedrooms, he said.
