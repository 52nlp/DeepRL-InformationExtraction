SACRAMENTO (CBS13) – The bounce house sits deflated a Natomas park, the fun replaced with fear at a 1-year-old’s birthday party. “Somebody called and said, ‘Don’t come to this party, they just shot this party up.’ I was like I don’t believe this. Sunday, investigators told CBS13 that they believe someone at the party fired back at some point during the shooting. Authorities ask anyone with information about the shooting to call the Sacramento Police Department.
