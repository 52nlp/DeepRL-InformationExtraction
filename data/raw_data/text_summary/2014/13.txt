A teen on a two-day crime spree was shot and killed by Ardmore, Okla. police Thursday night after shooting at least four people, including two agents of the Bureau of Alcochol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), Ardmore officers say. On Thursday, KXII reports police say, Jackson got into a scrape with an unnamed person who he shot in the hip. Thursday night, Ardmore officers were searching a neighborhood where they believed Jackson was hiding when, authorities say, Jackson was spotted in a silver Ford Taurus. CBS Sherman, Texas affiliate KXII-TV cites police as saying Jackson shot a 19-year-old woman as she was leaving her Ardmore home Wednesday night. None of the injuries suffered by the people shot by Henry Jackson, 18, was life-threatening, authorities say.
