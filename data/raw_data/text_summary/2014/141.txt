A 21-year-old college dropout who lived with his parents allegedly shot them and his teenage sister before turning the gun on himself, detectives said Thursday, identifying the family in a murder-suicide that stunned a hilltop Mission Viejo community. The family's deep faith brought them regularly to Mount of Olives Lutheran Church in Mission Viejo, where senior pastor John Steward reached out to parishioners struggling with grief. The gunman is believed to have targeted his father, Mark Harrison Sheer, 55; mother, Lydia Ann Sheer, 54; and sister, Amy Joanne Sheer, 15. The family lived in a spacious two-story home along the 26500 block of Pacific Hills Drive, near walking trails they often roamed. An initial investigation and evidence at the crime scene point to Michael Harrison Davis Sheer, 21, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Department.
