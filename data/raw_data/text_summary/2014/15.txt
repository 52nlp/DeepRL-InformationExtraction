Four people were shot and wounded in a drive-by incident at a Manassas sports bar early Monday, and police have arrested and charged a 24-year-old man in the case. Police said Jeremiah Eugene Pullen of Manassas was charged with malicious wounding and related counts in the incident and was being held without bond. They said Pullen was ejected from the bar just before 2 a.m. because he was acting disorderly and the bar was preparing to close. Police broadcast a description of Pullenâ€™s vehicle, and a Manassas City officer soon stopped and detained him, authorities said. The incident occurred just before 2:30 a.m. at the 90 Degrees bar on Rixlew Lane, police said.
