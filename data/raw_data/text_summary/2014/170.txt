The shooting came a day after violence at another unaffiliated pre-party for the BET Awards, which are due to take place Sunday evening in Los Angeles. "The two isolated incidents over the weekend occurred at locations with events that were unauthorized and unaffiliated with the BET Awards, BET Experience at L.A. LIVE or their partners," a BET statement said. One person was killed and four others wounded in a shooting early on Sunday at an unofficial pre-party in Los Angeles ahead of the Black Entertainment Television Awards show, police said. The BET Awards show is an annual event that honors black artists and other minorities in music, film, television, sports and entertainment. The gunman fired several rounds at the gathering, which BET said it had not organized, at a restaurant and banquet hall about 3 miles (5 km) west of downtown before fleeing, the Los Angeles Police Department said.
