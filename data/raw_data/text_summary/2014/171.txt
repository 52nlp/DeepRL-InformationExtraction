“There were a couple of parties last night and probably there will be more after the awards tonight,” Madison said. The shooting occurred at the Monalizza, a restaurant and banquet hall in the 1100 block of North Vermont Avenue. The shooting occurred at 5:17 a.m., when the gunman fired several rounds, Madison said. The event itself “was like an after-party even though the awards are tonight,” Madison said. The 14th BET Awards take place at 5 p.m. at the Nokia Theatre and will be hosted by Chris Rock.
