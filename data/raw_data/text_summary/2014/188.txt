Ronald and Melanie Haskell had been building a home in nearby Smithfield, but Melanie Haskell tried to escape her abusive marriage before it was finished, neighbors said. In October, both parties agreed to drop the protective order and enter into a "mutual restraining order. In July of 2013, Melanie Haskell filed for a protective order against her husband in 1st District Court in Logan. This protective order was actually served on him the day of the complaint. Neither protective order violations were prosecuted," police said in a prepared statement.
