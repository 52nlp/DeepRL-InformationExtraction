July 13, 2014 at 8:11 AMA woman was brought to Harborview Medical Center with life-threatening injuries after an early-morning shooting in Skyway that involved numerous victims. Five of them, including the woman victim later taken to Harborview, had been hit. It was unclear whether the gunshots came from someone within the crowd or from a vehicle, and the crowd scattered when deputies arrived, Gates said. Within a half hour, another victim arrived at Valley Medical Center, a third at Swedish and a fourth at Harborview. There, they found a small crowd of people behind a strip mall, the site of the former Club Afriq.
