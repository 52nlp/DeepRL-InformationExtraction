A suspect was killed and four Kent Police officers were injured in a Sunday afternoon shootout and explosion, authorities said. “We are extremely fortunate that none of our officers were critically injured by gunfire or the explosion” Frazier said. Due to concerns related to the chemical exposure with the propane explosion, local businesses were evacuated until the area was deemed safe. Five officers were involved in the shooting, and four officers received superficial burns, mainly singed hair, from the explosion, according to Det. Investigators have yet to determine if the tank was hit by one of the officer's bullets, or if the suspect shot it.
