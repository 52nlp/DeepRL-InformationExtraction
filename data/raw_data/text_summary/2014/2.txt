A 27-year-old Erie man was shot in the chest and killed Sunday shortly before 1 a.m. during a private party being held at the East Erie Turners building at 829 Parade St., Erie police said. The three wounded people -- a 20-year-old man and women ages 19 and 18, were taken to UPMC Hamot, Bowers said. Police said the incident happened inside during a private party being held in a second-floor ballroom of the Parade Street building, with between 100 and 200 people there. Bowers said the 27-year-old man was pronounced dead at Hamot, where a crowd gathered after the victims were taken there. All three were shot in the leg and the 19-year-old woman also was shot in the wrist, he said.
