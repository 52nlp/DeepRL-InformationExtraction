PITTSBURGH (AP) — Police say a dispute between two groups of men outside a Pittsburgh bar prompted a shooting early Saturday that killed one man and injured five others. Authorities say one of the North Side men began shooting at members of the motorcycle club. Witnesses saw a black SUV speeding from the scene, with gunfire coming from the front and rear windows. Pittsburgh police say words were exchanged outside Art’s Tavern in the Strip District between members of a motorcycle club called Pittsburgh Gentlemen from Homewood and a group of other men from the city’s North Side neighborhood. Police say 40-year-old Tyrone Tomman was killed.
