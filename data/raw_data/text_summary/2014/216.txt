(Published Monday, Aug. 4, 2014)A family of five, including three children, was found fatally shot in their Culpeper, Virginia, home in what appears to be a murder-suicide. Friends and family have been leaving flowers and other items outside the home, and neighbors have been sending food to Shauna Washington's mother. Family and friends told authorities the couple had been having an ongoing domestic dispute that apparently grew more heated Saturday night. Shauna Washington was born and raised in Culpeper. "There is a need for grief counseling and support for the girls, for their parents, for the various adult volunteers that Shauna worked with," Jennifer Pfister with Girl Scouts of Virginia said.
