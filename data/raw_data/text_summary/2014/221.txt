The incident occurred about 4 a.m. Sunday in the area of East 9th Street and Bridge Street in Columbia, near The Down Low Restaurant, Columbia Police Department Sgt. A resident who lives on Bridge Street behind the Down Low Restaurant said she was not aware of the shooting near her home. Four people were hit by bullets and a fifth was apparently struck by debris from a bullet ricochet during an early Sunday shooting in Columbia, authorities said. Kash said he doesn’t believe the Down Low Restaurant was open at the time of the shootings. She was also not aware a shooting happened near her home, but she called the situation “ridiculous” when a Daily Herald reporter described the incident.
