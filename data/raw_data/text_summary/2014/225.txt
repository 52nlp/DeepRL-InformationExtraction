CHICAGO (CBS) — Four people wounded early Wednesday in a shooting outside a Goose Island nightclub. One victim had been shot in the leg and groin, the other had been shot in the chest and back. In April, a man was shot inside the club after a fight broke out in the hallway. That victim was listed in serious condition immediately after the shooting. They broke the fight, and then the fight started back again down the lot, and then that’s where the gunshots started,” she said.
