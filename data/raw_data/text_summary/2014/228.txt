Albuquerque police are searching for a man who officers said shot four women Friday, killing one of them. Three women inside of the shop were hit, including one who is pregnant. Police said Delgado sent Vigil several threatening text messages about 20 minutes before the attack because he was upset about her new boyfriend. In 2005 court records show Delgado was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia, resisting arrest and possession with the intent to distribute. Police expect the women and the dog to be OK.One of the women has since been released from the hospital.
