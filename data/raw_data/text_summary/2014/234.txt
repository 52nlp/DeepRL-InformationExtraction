A drive-by shooting in a New Orleans has left a man and an 18-year-old woman dead and five others wounded, three of them children, police said. The dead man appeared to be in his late 20s, Robertson said in an email. After about three hours of negotiations, the 20-year-old man apparently shot himself and the SWAT team stormed in. The older man kept asking his friend to put the gun down, Robertson said, but about 6:30am, the 20-year-old man shot him in the chest. A woman and two children, aged 2 and 4, were in a critical condition and a 13-year-old girl and a 37-year-old woman were stable after the shooting in the lower ninth ward, Frank Robertson, a police spokesman, said in a news release.
