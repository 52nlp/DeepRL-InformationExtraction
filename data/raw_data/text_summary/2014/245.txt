SALT LAKE CITY (AP) â€” Police are looking for a gunman who opened fire at a crowded nightclub in downtown Salt Lake City, shooting six people. Some of the injuries are serious, but none appear to be life threatening, Salt Lake City police Lt. Craig Gleason said Sunday. "As they were fleeing, it looks like they attempted to run over a security guard," he told the Salt Lake Tribune. Hundreds of people fled the Inferno Cantina Night Club after the shots rang out about 11:45 p.m. Saturday. "We have some suspects that we're looking for, but as of yet we don't have them in custody," Gleason told KSL-TV.
