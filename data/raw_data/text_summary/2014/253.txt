According to Walker, the husband surprised his wife and shot and killed her then shot and killed their children. Police say four people found shot to death inside an east Tulsa apartment Tuesday morning died in a murder-suicide. Officers say the four were found in an apartment at the Bradford Townhouses in the 2100 block of South 109th East Avenue. Homicide detectives say it appears a 35-year-old man shot his 22-year-old wife and then their two children, a five-year-old girl and a three-year-old boy, before killing himself. Walker says the woman dropped the couple's children off at the husband's apartment Monday evening.
