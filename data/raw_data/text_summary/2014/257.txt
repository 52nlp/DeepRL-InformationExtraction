“The shots rang out like ‘Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!’ and all I could do was just jump up and try to run downstairs to see where she was at, to see what was going on. The 18-year-old woman, identified by relatives as Aundrea Garland, was fatally shot. Police say one of the men got out of the vehicle’s front passenger door and opened fire with a “high-powered weapon,” striking the four victims in their bodies. In that case, a man and woman were wounded as they left the mall around 3:30 p.m. near the vacant Sears store. The homeowner, who did not want to be named, said the victims were just “kids being kids,” hanging around outside when the shooting happened.
