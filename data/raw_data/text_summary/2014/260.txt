George Mason III (Photo: WTSP)Brooksville, Florida â€” A community is mourning tonight after the worst shooting Brooksville has seen in recent memory. Investigators later found Taylor shot multiple times, lying in the roadway. "He didn't have to kill them people like that, he didn't have to kill that lady, he didn't have to kill none of them. He said an unsuspecting man accidentally slammed his truck into Mason as he was running on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. They're all family," said Linda Stanley who lives two houses down from where Brooksville Police say George Mason III shot and killed three people.
