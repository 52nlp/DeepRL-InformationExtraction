Suspect arrested in Livermore house party shootingAuthorities arrested a suspect on suspicion of five counts of attempted murder Sunday after he allegedly opened fire on a house party in Livermore, police said. Authorities swarmed to the home and immediately began rendering aid after finding multiple shooting victims, police said. The shooting happened after three men, who were invited to the party, were asked to leave when they got into an argument with another person, police said. Around 12:30 a.m., officers heard shots coming from a home on the 200 block of South Q Street. The men left, but about half an hour later, police said a white sedan pulled up in front of the house, and someone got out and opened fire on guests at the 20-person party.
