The shooting happened just after 3 a.m. near the Kwik Stop's Kaley Avenue entrance, according to Orange County Sheriff's Office Sgt. The shooting victims have been identified as Thomas May, 26, , Joseph Edwards, 28, , Demetria Childers, 27, and Roger Montgomery, 29. A drive-by shooting at a gas station on South Orange Blossom Trail early Saturday sent four people in their twenties to the hospital, officials said. Officials say shots were fired at the group "loitering" near the gas station from a passing vehicle with multiple men inside. The victims were taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries, Sheriff's Office spokesman Jeff Williamson said.
