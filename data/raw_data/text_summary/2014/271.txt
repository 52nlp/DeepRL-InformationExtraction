NOW LAUREN, THE INDIVIDUAL WRIT SHOOTING STARTED WAS THAT BEING HELD FOR SOMEONE WHO ALSO DIED IN A VIOLENT CRIME? A VIOLENT NIGHT ON DETROIT'S NORTHWEST SIDE HAD POLICE INVESTIGATING TWO SCENES AFTER MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE SHOT AT A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL. YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE SHOOTING MULTIPLE WEAPONS RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE CONFIRMED THAT FOUR PEOPLE WERE INJURED FROM GUNSHOT WOUNDS AT THAT HOME ON PATENT STREET. DETROIT POLICE CHIEF JAMES CRAIG JUST KIND OF WALKED THE MEDIA THROUGH EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AND AS YOU MENTIONED IT IS COMPLICATED. DETROIT POLICE SAY THREE WEAPONS WERE RECOVERED INCLUDING A PISTOL IN THE CAR AND AN ASSAULT RIFLE AT THE HOME.
