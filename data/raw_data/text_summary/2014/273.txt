Police interviewed numerous Marina Village residents and could not immediately determine a motive for the shooting. Blue and red lights reflected on the white picket fence surrounding the park as residents watched multiple crime scene investigators and police vehicles drive under the yellow and black crime scene tape. Neighbors and witnesses helped police locate the suspect, a 63-year-old man who police have not identified. Alanis said detectives will continue to work into Monday morning and release details as they become available. One child suffered gunshot wounds and was transported to Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial.
