Five men where shot Monday night (Sept. 15) at an eastern New Orleans intersection called "Million Dollar Corner" by locals for the prolific drug deals conducted in plain view. Last month, two men ages 65 and 23 were shot multiple times near that intersection. The 27-year-old was struck multiple times, while the remaining men were each shot once, said Robertson, citing preliminary information. Two of the men were taken to an area hospital by ambulance while three arrived by private vehicle, Robertson said. The next block over on Chef Menteur, 43-year-old Clarence Wilson was shot in the head back in May following an argument near the intersection of Chef Menteur and America Street.
