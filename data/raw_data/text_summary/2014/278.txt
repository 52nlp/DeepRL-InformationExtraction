A grandfather shot dead his daughter and her six children before taking his own life at a home in Bell, Florida, police have said. The children range in age from three months to 10 years old, said Gilchrist County Sheriff Robert Schultz. According to the Florida Department of Corrections, the grandfather was once behind bars for a gun charge, and was released in February 2006. Each time innocent victims die, but this rural community has been shaken by the multiple killing, says the BBC's Tom Esslemont in Washington. It is likely to reopen a painful debate about gun ownership, but is unlikely to change deeply entrenched polarised views, our correspondent adds.
