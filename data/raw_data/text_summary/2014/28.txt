This shooting followed another mall shooting in New Jersey in November, during which the gunman fired six shots before killing himself. One of the injured persons suffered a gunshot wound to the foot, and four others were injured in the chaos, police said. Aguilar graduated from high school last year and was working at a Dunkinâ€™ Donuts store near his home. The Maryland mall, not far from the state capitol of Baltimore, reopened on Monday. Aguilar never arrived at work the morning of the shooting, and his mother reported him missing at 1:40 p.m., roughly three hours after the shooting had occurred.
