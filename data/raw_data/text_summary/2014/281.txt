Schultz said Spirit shot his grandchildren and "a daughter" but would not say if Spirit had another daughter. Gilchrist County Sheriff Robert Schultz identified the gunman as Don Charles Spirit, 51, and said the shootings occurred at Spirit's home near 29th Terrace and 30th Street, northeast of Bell. A Gilchrist County deputy arrived at Spirit's home, had a discussion with Spirit, at which point Spirit fatally shot himself, Schultz said. Neighbor Maryann Vincent said Spirit has other children including a son, adding that various people lived in the home at times. He also would not say if any survivors who witnessed the shootings were at the house when the deputy arrived.
