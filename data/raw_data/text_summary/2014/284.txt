KELLI KENNEDYAssociated PressMIAMI (AP) â€” A shooting sent terrified patrons scrambling from a Miami nightclub early Sunday and left 15 people wounded, including an 11-year-old child, authorities said. Rescuers found wounded people inside and outside the club, some too hurt to flee, Miami Fire Rescue Capt. Fire Rescue officials also will check on what kind of gatherings the club is licensed for, if any, Carroll said. Many young people were at the site; at least three of the wounded were transferred to a pediatric unit, Carroll said. When Miami police and rescue crews arrived at a club called The Spot around 1 a.m., they said they found chaos among the large throng of adults and teenagers gathered there.
