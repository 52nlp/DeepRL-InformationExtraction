That's the question being asked as investigators combed the school late Friday for clues and interviewed students who witnessed the shooting. But two weeks ago, according to Luton, Fryberg got into a fight after somebody said "something racist" to him. While authorities have not detailed what occurred inside or identified the shooter, students offered up accounts that painted a terrifying, chaotic picture. A Beretta .40-caliber handgun is believed to have been used, a federal law enforcement source told CNN. When the shooting stopped, he said he looked out and saw the shooter was trying to reload.
