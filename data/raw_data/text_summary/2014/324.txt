TABERNACLE, N.J. — A shooting at a home in a secluded wooded area of southern New Jersey left two children dead and a woman believed to be their mother and the children’s brother critically wounded, state police said Thursday. The woman had a single shot to her head; officials would not say where the children were shot. Five other people live in the home, but authorities say none reported hearing any shooting. Police did not release the name of the victims, saying they need to reach next of kin first. “It’s going to be a long time before we know exactly what happened,” state police Detective Geoff Noble said.
