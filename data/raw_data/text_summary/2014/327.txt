A 22-year-old man apparently shot and killed three people and wounded a fourth at a home on a South Dakota American Indian reservation early on Saturday, before he killed himself, authorities said. A Sisseton hospital official said a woman wounded in the attack was flown to Fargo hospital and was in stable condition. Joyce Arbach, of Sisseton, said she was related to Colter Arbach but that her family and his did not associate much. The attorney generalâ€™s office identified the alleged attacker as a local man, Colter Richard Arbach. She said she had not seen him since she was a substitute aide and teacher at Sisseton high school, from which he graduated in 2011.
