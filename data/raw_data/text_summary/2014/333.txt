Jose Hernandez Benitez, 24, was arrested Friday in Caldwell County, where he fled after the shooting, said Fred Thomas, a spokesman for the Williamson County Sheriff’s Office. Authorities have arrested a man accused of killing two people and wounding three others Thursday night in a trailer park off of County Road 934 in Weir, a small town in central Williamson County. Benitez had been sending text messages to Yazmin Corona about wanting to date her, Williamson County District Attorney Jana Duty said. At a party Thursday night, Corona and Omar Ruiz were talking about the text messages and mocking Benitez, which put Benitez “over the edge,” Duty said. Benitez was transported to the Williamson County Jail on murder charges.
