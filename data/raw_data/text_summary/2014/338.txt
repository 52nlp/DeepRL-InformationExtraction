The victims, three men and one woman in their early 20s, were shot outside an event hall in East Flatbush while the baby shower was taking place inside, a law enforcement official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the Police Department was still investigating the shooting. The driver had been in a fight at the shower, the police said, and drove into a crowd of people who were leaving. “I think that there’s a better way to resolve our conflicts without pulling out a gun.”The shooting occurred less than a month after a man was killed and two people were injured by a motorist at a baby shower in Queens.
