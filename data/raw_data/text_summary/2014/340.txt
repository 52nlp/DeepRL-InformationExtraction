The shooting also comes about three years after another mass shooting related to domestic violence in Monongalia County. A Westover man who police believe was responsible for four fatal shootings in Monongalia County Monday morning was found dead Monday evening, according to West Virginia State Police. M. Starsick said all schools in Monongalia County were placed on lockdown Monday, but police have no reason to believe schools were being targeted. The owner of another Monongalia County towing company, J&J Towing, is listed as Jody L. Hunt on the West Virginia Secretary of State’s Office website. He deferred questions about the shootings in Westover and on Sweet Pea Lane to the Monongalia County Sheriff’s Department.
