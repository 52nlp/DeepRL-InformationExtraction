ST. LOUIS • A former city police officer who shot a robber at a south St. Louis bar in 2008 did it again late Tuesday night in a gunfight that wounded him and four others, and killed a woman. “It’s amazing that it happened the first time,” said Phil “Ward Cleaver” Scharf, 65, of St. Louis, a retired accountant who has been the 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. bartender since the 1990s. In late November 1995, an off-duty St. Louis narcotics detective wrestled with a robber at Pooh’s and was struck in the forehead with the barrel of a sawed-off shotgun. The detective then pulled a pistol from his jacket and fatally shot the robber, Anthony Bickell, 18. On Sept. 15, 2008, the former officer in Tuesday night’s shootout was working as a bartender at Pooh’s when he stopped two would-be robbers.
