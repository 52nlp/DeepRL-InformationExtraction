Authorities in Florida are hunting for a suspect they believe killed his wife, a church pastor, and another woman in Bradenton Thursday. Bayshore church member told WFLA that she was devastated by the shooting. Deputies later found the bodies of Avalos' wife, Amber Avalos, and another woman at a home about 10 miles away, the station reported. The couple has six children, and officials told WFLA all are accounted for and safe. A church member and the Bayshore website say Amber Avalos was nursery and children's director at the church.
