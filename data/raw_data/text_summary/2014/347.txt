According to a release issued by St. Joseph County Police, a county police officer was conducting a traffic stop nearby when he heard several shots fired. St. Joseph County detectives investigating the shooting have “one guy they’re looking at,” although no arrests have been made, Blank noted. An outdoor affair exploded into gunshots early Sunday morning at a St. Joseph County banquet hall, leaving four wounded, with three hospitalized and one victim fleeing an ambulance. The shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m. at The Oaks, a parties and special events rental hall in the 16000 block of Roosevelt Road, in rural southeastern St. Joseph County. “We had gotten some complaints from people in the area about cars driving recklessly along Roosevelt Road,” said Lt. Matt Blank of the St. Joseph County Police Department.
