Four people, including two boys, ages 13 and 14, were shot in an attack in the Washington Park neighborhood Monday afternoon, relatives and authorities said. A Chicago Fire Department spokesman said ambulances had treated victims at the Michigan Avenue location, but referred all calls to police News Affairs. The boy shot in the chest was taken to Comer Children's Hospital for treatment, while the other boy was in good condition at a local hospital, Zala said. Relatives and friends at Comer said the two hospitalized there were ages 13 and 14. A 15-year-old boy was treated for gunshot wounds to his wrist and knee and was released from Stroger Monday night.
