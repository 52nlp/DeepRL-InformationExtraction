Minutes later, the 17-year-old lay dead in a driveway near the restaurant, shot by a masked gunman who wounded three other teens. Markeyo Carr had grabbed a few bucks from his mother and headed to the McDonald's in Rogers Park for something to eat. A girl, about 15, was shot several times and apparently ran into a bathroom in the McDonald's, authorities said. The woman said that as she approached the McDonald's she saw someone in a mask passing in the opposite direction. Another 18-year-old man with a gunshot wound to the arm walked into Weiss Memorial Hospital saying he had been shot at the McDonald's, authorities said.
