A teenage boy was killed and three others were injured in a shooting at a McDonald's parking lot in Rogers Park. Chicago police say a 17-year-old boy was fatally shot in the parking lot at Pratt Boulevard and Clark Street on the North Side. They said they believe gang activity had nothing to do with the shooting and that the young man involved was an innocent bystander. Faye McCoy was getting her taxes done across the street when the retired nurse heard the gunshots. There is gang activity in the area, but Ceasefire said the organization recently brokered a treaty between rivals in the area.
