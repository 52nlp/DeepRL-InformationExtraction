Four bodies were discovered in an Ohio home on Thursday in what authorities believe was a triple-murder-suicide. Local television station WANE reports that the Defiance County sheriff’s department found the handgun they believe Garza used during the incident inside the home. Authorities are investigating whether Robert Garza, Sr. shot and killed his wife, daughter and teenaged granddaughter before turning the gun on himself. A relative found the bodies after stopping by the home in Defiance County, which is in between Toledo and Fort Wayne, to check on the family, Toledo News Now reports. Sheriff David Westrick said Garza was a Vietnam veteran and had been battling “health issues,” though police are still investigating a motive.
