Five people, including the suspected gunman, were shot at the Safe and Sound Social Club in Gary, Indiana. In 2011, Safe and Sound Senior Citizen Social Club was raided twice for serving liquor without a license. Gary police are investigating a shooting Wednesday night at a social club for senior citizens. Shots were fired and police say at one point, one of the patrons inside shot the gunman. Sturgis says one gunman took off while the other pointed a gun at him and three other club patrons.
