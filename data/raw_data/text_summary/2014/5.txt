Because several juveniles were present when the shooting took place, Huntsville Police Chief Lewis Morris has suspended the city liquor license. The Bench Warmer is listed as a lounge with an entertainment license, and the liquor license stipulates that anyone allowed inside must be 19 years of age or older. The club has also lost its liquor license for the time being. Police say the teen has been arrested before, and say the shooting stemmed from a fight inside the bar. In all, five people were shot during a fight inside the club -- two juveniles and three adults.
