From the Sun Sentinel:"People didn't know what it was," said Grant. Although the restaurant was crowded, uninjured patrons reportedly didn't know that the sound they heard was a gunshot. An off-duty Florida corrections officer reached into his pocket for a valet ticket at the Fort Lauderdale eatery on Saturday evening, but somehow he found the trigger of his handgun. One of the injured patrons was treated at a nearby hospital. The Associated Press reports that the bullet hit the base of a table and burst into fragments, sending shrapnel around the room.
