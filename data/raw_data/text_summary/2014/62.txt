Police in Alturas, California say four are dead and two are critically injured following a shooting at a native American tribal hall Wednesday evening. The Rancheria owns 26 acres in Cedarville, Calif., and many of its families reside there, according to the tribe's website. The tribal office in Alturas hosts tribal events and activities like council meetings, youth tutoring and holiday celebrations. Officials said Rhoades is a former leader at the Cedarville Rancheria. Police said it could take days to process the Planned Parenthood shooting that killed three people, including university campus officer Garrett Swasey.
