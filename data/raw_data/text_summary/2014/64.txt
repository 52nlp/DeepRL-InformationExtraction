The tribal office in Alturas hosts tribal events and activities like council meetings, youth tutoring and holiday celebrations. During the hearing, Rhoades drew a semi-automatic handgun and started shooting, Barnes said. Cherie Lash Rhoades, a former tribal leader and chairwoman of Cedarville Rancheria in Modoc County, was arrested after the attack, said Alturas Police Chief Ken Barnes. One of the people who escaped the attack, and was covered in blood, ran to the Alturas police station to report the attack, Barnes said. Four people were shot in the tribal office and a fifth was shot trying to flee, police said.
