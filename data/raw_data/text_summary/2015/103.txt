Camp said the two shooting victims at the house were transported by air ambulance to Atlanta area hospitals. Camp said the shooting at the liquor store is under investigation by the RCSO while the GBI has been called in to investigate the shooting at the Ebenezer Road residence. Investigator Michael Camp said the suspect opened fire on a deputy who was called to the Ebenezer Road home with an assault rifle. The suspect then fled to a home on Ebenezer Road where two people were shot. The deputy fired back and shot the suspect, who has not been identified.
