ST. LOUIS • A shooter or shooters opened fire on a north St. Louis park full of children and adults late Tuesday afternoon, killing a mother of two young children and wounding three men. The incident happened at about 4:50 p.m. at Rumbold Park, a small neighborhood park with playground equipment near North Market Street and North Spring Avenue in the Jeff-Vander-Lou neighborhood. “She was nice, a sweet mother, and she loved those kids and didn't bother anybody,” said her great-aunt, Sharon Dorsey, 50. In addition, Dorsey's mother, Tarlisa Davis, said the children were not in the park at the time of the shooting. Relatives gathered at the park Tuesday evening to cry, comfort one another, and wonder why anyone would shoot into a park where children were playing.
