By Richard WeizelBRIDGEPORT, Conn. (Reuters) - One man was shot dead and eight other people were injured at an apartment complex in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in the early hours of Thursday morning in what a former mayor described as the worst attack he has ever seen in the city. Five other men and three women were injured in the attack, most suffering wounds to their arms and legs. The man who was killed was Savonnie McNeil, 37, of Shelton, a nearby suburb, said Gaudett. Police believe the attack by at least two gunmen in the complex's parking lot may have resulted from a dispute between rival gangs, Police Chief Joseph Gaudett told reporters. One woman was shot in the stomach, but is expected to survive.
