Theodore Parisienne for New York Daily News Five people were injured in violence outside D Avenue Sports Bar on Flatbush Ave. near Hawthorne St., Brooklyn, early Monday. He was hanging out at a Brooklyn bar to promote his new clothing line when he was nearly killed in hail of bullets. Video surveillance shows a group of men in their 20s fleeing the scene after a fight began inside the bar and spilled outside. Davison, the youngest of 10 children and the father of three, was shot in the neck, but is expected to survive. Four people were shot — one was stabbed — adding to a troubling rise in the number of gunshot victims in the city.
