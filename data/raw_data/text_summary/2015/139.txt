GRANITE CITY — Investigators believe the man killed in a single-vehicle accident Sunday had been shot and may have been coming from the scene of a multi-victim shooting. Granite City Police responded to the scene at 1:24 a.m., and Roberson was pronounced dead at the scene shortly thereafter. Shellenberg said the investigation is ongoing, and being coordinated among the Venice and Granite City police departments and the Illinois State Police. The autopsy on Roberson indicated he had been shot in the right knee, but that wound was not the cause of his death. Instead, he was killed due to blunt force injuries sustained in the crash, according to the coroner’s statement.
