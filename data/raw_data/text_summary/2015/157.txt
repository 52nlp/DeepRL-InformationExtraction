THREE ADULTS HAVE ALSO BEEN INJURED AND SHOOTING HAPPENING ON WEST FIELD AND MEMORIAL STREET ON DETROIT'S WEST SIDE. SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE OUTSIDE NEAR CORNER OF MEMORIAL AND WEST FIELD STREETS WHEN A CAR DROVE BY AND STARTED SHOOTING. NEVER EASY WHEN ANYONE IS INJURED AND PARTICULARLY WHEN YOUNG CHILD IS INJURED AND PROVIDE INFORMATION WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET. POLICE ARE CALLING THIS A DRIVE-BY SHOOTING AND JUST SO SAD THAT A CHILD HAD TO GET HURT IN ALL OF THIS FOOLISHNESS. NEVER EASY WHEN A CHILD IS INJURED.
