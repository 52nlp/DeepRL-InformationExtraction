As the officer chased the stolen pickup, Lord started shooting out his window at the officer, police said. Police say Lord shot and killed Irish’s boyfriend, Kyle Hewitt, 22, and Kevin Tozier, 58, of Lee. The suspect, registered sex offender Anthony Lord, also is charged with kidnapping a 21-year-old woman, who was freed when Lord was arrested in Houlton. Investigators, who were trying to piece together a motive for Lord’s violence, said Irish and Lord know each other, but didn’t indicate how. Tozier was shot while Lord was stealing a pulp truck from a Lee woodlot, police said.
