“We don't know why he decided to stop and stay in Lafayette,” Craft said. Houser entered the theater alone and took a seat; about 25 patrons were in attendance, according to authorities. On Thursday night, about 20 minutes into the movie “Trainwreck,” Houser stood up in a theater in Lafayette, La., and began firing with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, killing two moviegoers and injuring nine, according to police. A woman in the theater jumped in front of a fellow teacher, taking a bullet for her, officials said. Houser had been living in a Lafayette motel this month after arriving from Alabama.
