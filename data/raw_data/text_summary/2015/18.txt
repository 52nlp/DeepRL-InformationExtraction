Omaha police block the intersection close to the scene of a shooting on Saturday in Omaha, Neb. Young said her daughter knew the person throwing the party. She said her daughter agreed and told her she was going elsewhere Friday night, but that she apparently went to the party anyway. The vast majority of people at the scene refused to help police, the chief said during a news conference Saturday evening. As many as 50 people were in and around the small home when shots were fired "by multiple shooters" around 2 a.m., Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said.
