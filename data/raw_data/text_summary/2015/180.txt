He was rushed to Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children with likely permanent damage to his left eye. A police update Monday included surveillance photos "of interest" of the vehicles in the parking lot at the time of the shooting. The three were identified as a 17-year-old boy, Louis Suarez, 21, and Diego Hernandez, whose age wasn't released by police. When Gloria Perez returned home from doing laundry Saturday night, she saw her 10-year-old grandson running toward her car while screaming and covering his bleeding left eye. "I could see blood trails all along the hallways and in the parking lots," an officer said in the report.
