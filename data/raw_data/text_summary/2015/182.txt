The shooting in East New York on Sunday was one of two overnight in which multiple people were struck. Soon scores of neighbors and others in search of a place to party filled the backyard of the two-story, brick-front Brooklyn home. No motive had emerged in that killing, or in another overnight, at the Walt Whitman Houses, near Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, where a 46-year-old man was shot. Two of the victims, a woman, 21, and a 24-year-old man, were struck in the neck. The wounded at the party in Brooklyn included one man and five women who ranged in age from 19 to 37 and were each struck in the leg.
