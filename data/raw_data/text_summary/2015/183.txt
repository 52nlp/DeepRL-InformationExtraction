Police responded to an area hospital at 2:26 a.m. Sunday, where five people walked in with gunshot wounds. All seven victims suffered gunshot wounds to their legs, and were listed in stable condition, police said. The shootings transpired amid a violent two-hour span in Baltimore in which 10 people were shot and one man was killed. sjwelsh@baltsun.comTwitter.com/seanjwelshEditor's note: This story has been updated from an earlier version, which — based upon information from Baltimore police — misstated the block in which the shooting occurred.
