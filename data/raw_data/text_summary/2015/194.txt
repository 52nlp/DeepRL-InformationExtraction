“Our investigators have determined a subject was involved in an altercation in the parking lot of Pit Stop Pub,” he said. A man who lives near the Pit Stop Pub complained about the establishment to Orangeburg County Council in June. That led investigators to the Pit Stop Pub located about two miles south of Orangeburg. Orangeburg County Sheriff Leroy Ravenell said the shooting happened just after 4 a.m. following a fight at a Bamberg Highway nightclub. If anyone has information on the shooting, they are asked to call the sheriff’s office at 803-534-3550 or Crimestoppers at 1-888-CRIME-SC.
