DURHAM, N.C. (WNCN) – Eight people were injured in a drive-by shooting incident in Durham Friday night. Witnesses told police that they saw four gun barrels pointing out of the car with multiple people shooting. No one was killed but one person among the seven men and one women who were injured is in serious condition following the shooting in the 2700 block of Hinson Drive just before 10:30 p.m., authorities said. Police said the victims were at a cookout at a private home, but have not said if the victims are related. And you would hate to see any of them hurt because grown people don’t know how to handle their own affairs,” Veney said.
