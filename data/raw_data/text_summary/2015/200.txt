Pine Hills Road was closed for several hours from Colonial Drive to the 408 as the investigation continued. The incident began unfolding around 8 p.m. when Orange County deputies responded to the ramp onto State Road 408 near Pine Hills Road in reference to a shooting, Clayton said. An Orange County sheriff's helicopter was spotted flying overhead late Saturday night as deputies investigated the three active crime scenes. Three men walked into a Pine Hills gas station with gunshot wounds Saturday night as a fourth shooting victim was found about six miles away, officials said. At the same time, three shooting victims walked into the Circle K on West Colonial Drive near Powers Drive, according to Clayton.
