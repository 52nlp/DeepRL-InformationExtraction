"It's horrible and it's sad, but this definitely had nothing to do with X Fest. "Some people that attended the event attended the party," he said. The shooting occurred outside a warehouse a few miles from the festival, in an industrial section of Modesto, the police said in a release. The concert, called the X Fest, bills itself as the "biggest party" in California's Central Valley. Festival promoter Chris Ricci told NBC News the party was an "unsanctioned" and "unpermitted" event, and that it was not officially connected to X Fest.
