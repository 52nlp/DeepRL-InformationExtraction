Mr. Flanagan shot and killed himself hours later after being cornered by the police on a highway about 200 miles away. Ms. Parker, 24, a reporter, and Mr. Ward, 27, a cameraman, both white, were pronounced dead at the scene. Two minutes later, apparently referring to Mr. Ward, he wrote, “Adam went to hr on me after working with me one time!! “Alison made racist comments,” he wrote on Twitter just after the shooting, an apparent reference to Ms. Parker. “Why did I do it?” Mr. Flanagan said in the rambling fax message, which The New York Times obtained from a law enforcement official.
