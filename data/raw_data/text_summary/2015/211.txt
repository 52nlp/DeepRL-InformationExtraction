“We think it is an absolute tragedy that in Charlotte-Mecklenburg we are seeing this type of violence,” Estes said. The dead include a 7-year-old boy killed during a birthday party around 9 p.m. Saturday in a front yard in southwest Charlotte. Another child and two other adults were wounded, but their injuries were not life threatening, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Deputy Chief Jeff Estes said. The other three fatal shootings this weekend also remain unsolved, Estes said. The sudden spate of violence led officials to call in officers from days off and vacation to help patrol and investigate, Estes said.
