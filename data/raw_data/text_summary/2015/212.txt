Four people were shot outside a Daytona Beach club Saturday and the shooter is still on the loose, police said. “Being a mother and knowing that’s your child and your child is shot, you’re not hearing where she’s shot or nothing, I freaked out,” said Lisa McMillian, the mother of victim Latoya Kennedy. Three of the victims suffered non-life-threatening injuries, while another was shot in the stomach and is fighting for his life. Innocent people, I mean, nobody should get shot, whether you’re innocent or not,” said McMillian. McMillian hasn’t slept since she got the call at 3:30 a.m. saying that her daughter was shot in the leg.
