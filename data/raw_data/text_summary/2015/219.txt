One witness driving by the scene heard the “pop, pop, pop” of gunshots and saw people running in the streets. Minneapolis’ mayor and police chief on Saturday decried overnight violence that left six people wounded by gunfire after an altercation near downtown’s Target Center. The six who were shot received noncritical injuries and were treated at Hennepin County Medical Center. Minneapolis police officers were nearby and took three people into custody. The mayor pledged a full investigation into the circumstances leading to the incident, which occurred around the time most downtown bars close.
