FORT MYERS, Fla.- Fort Myers Police Chief Dennis Eads says he believes there’s a connection between three of the four shootings that injured seven people on Wednesday. “How ironic that such gun violence occurred on our streets yesterday, a day on which a conference on gun violence was held,” he wrote in an e-mail to city leaders. Fort Myers Police Chief Dennis Eads says the shootings frustrate him. Tazyhion Matthews, 5, of Fort Myers; Orvasia Green, 17, of Lehigh Acres; Jatravia Isom, 24, and Chancey Isom, 26, both of Fort Myers, were shot while inside a vehicle near the intersection of Dale Street and Veronica S. Shoemaker Boulevard at about 9 p.m. Police believe the first Davis Court shooting, the shooting at Colonial, and the shooting of 4, are related.
