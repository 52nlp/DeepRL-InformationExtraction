The baby survived and was in stable condition, but his mother and grandmother were both killed, police said. Outside Stroger Hospital, relatives identified the two women as Patricia Chew, the mother of 11-month-old Princeton, and Lolita Wells, the boy’s grandmother. Two other men who were with the women, who were all returning from a family outing, were also wounded. “You have an innocent family coming home from a family outing,” Deputy Chief Eugene Roy told reporters at the scene. Chew raced outside to find the unthinkable: Her 11-month-old nephew and her pregnant sister on the ground and bloody.
