CINCINNATI -- Four men and a child were shot Monday evening in Cincinnati's Evanston neighborhood. "Neighbors Work To Chart New CourseNeighborhood leaders have been working to revitalize Evanston in recent years, after decades of decline that some -- including Evanston Community Council president Anzora Adkins -- attribute to the construction of Interstate 71. One of the things that attracted the Port Authority to Evanston was the community council and the all-hands-on-deck approach of Adkins and her cohorts. The Port plans to purchase 40 Evanston homes and rehabilitate them for energy efficiency while maintaining their historic character. Some of the victims went in private vehicles to hospitals for treatment; others were transported by the Cincinnati Fire Department.
