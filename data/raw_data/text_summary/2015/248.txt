"At the time of the shooting, school officials said, one unarmed security guard was on duty. "There's been another mass shooting in America, this time at a community college in Oregon," the president said. "We are a community college in the best sense of the word," said Rita Cavin, Umpqua's interim president. Football games and other sporting events were postponed Thursday night, and school systems across Douglas County have cancelled classes Friday. At least two officers exchanged fire with him, said Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin.
