“I heard the continuous bam bam bam bam,” said resident Sylvia Roy. BALTIMORE (WJZ) — Police are searching for information about a lone gunman who they say shot five people in broad daylight. But it’s a grim reality even for some of the city’s youngest residents, coming home to flashing lights and evidence markers. And it’s becoming too common, residents say. Tuesday’s violence comes four days after a handful of people were shot in a city strip mall parking lot.
