WREG reached out to a man we believe to be an owner of the shopping center but have not yet heard back. Moriah Road near the parking lot of Peachtree Center shopping complex. Four of the victims were transported to Regional Medical Center in critical condition but have been stabilized and sent home. The owner of the bar did not want WREG to identify her but said the trouble began outside a business further down the complex. Outside the Deseo Bar and Grill, police found a crowd who reported hearing gunshots.
