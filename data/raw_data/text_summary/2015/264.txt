CALUMET CITY, Ill. (STMW) - Seven people were wounded in a drive-by shooting Monday night at a gathering that followed a funeral in south suburban Calumet City.

A few of the mourners walked to a nearby liquor store where they got into an argument with some other patrons, Gilmore said. A large group had gathered at a home in the 300 block of South Campbell after the funeral, Calumet City Police Chief Edward Gilmore said. Seven people, all adults in their early 30s to mid-40s, were shot, Gilmore said.
