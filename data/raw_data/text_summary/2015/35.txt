BALTIMORE (WJZ)—A violent end to February in Baltimore, with a quadruple shooting that left one dead on Saturday afternoon. Most of a block was taped off, as Baltimore Police sealed off a mass shooting scene on the 4300 block of Welbourne Road in the northeastern part of the city. But Welbourne Road sat mostly deserted, and neighbors kept to themselves. We know the one victim that is deceased is not from this area,” said Rich Worley, Northeast Commander, Baltimore City Police Dept. When officers arrived just before 4 o’clock one person was found dead in the street, which was littered with shell casings.
