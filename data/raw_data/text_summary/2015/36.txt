The newspaper reported O'Sullivan said the Missouri State Highway Patrol is investigating the officer-involved shooting, and the Sheriff's Department is investigating the initial shooting. Investigators had not released the names of the gunman and victims or disclosed a possible motive for the initial shooting. The Columbia Missourian reported the initial shooting occurred in the 4400 block of Santa Anna Drive, just east of Columbia. "Our deputy killed the suspect," the newspaper quoted O'Sullivan as saying. The confrontation between the suspected shooter and the deputy took place at the intersection of Broadway and U.S. 63, Sheriff's Department Detective Tom O'Sullivan said.
