A man was shot and killed during an altercation early Monday morning in Santa Ana that left four other men injured, police said. The men were taken to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana, he said. More than 20 witnesses and patrons were waiting at the Santa Ana Police Department on Monday morning to be interviewed by investigators, who are hoping they may be able to shed more light on the incident. "The shooting suspects attempted to flee, and security guards and patrons continued the altercation, and the other two suspects sustained nonlife-threatening injuries," Bertagna said. At least two of the men were initially considered suspects, although police said there may be one additional suspect.
