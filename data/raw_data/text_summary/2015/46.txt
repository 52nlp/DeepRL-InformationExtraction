Investigators are determining what caused a man to shoot six people in Mesa, Arizona. Mesa police identified the suspect as Ryan Elliott Giroux, an ex-convict with a criminal record dating back to the mid-1990s. Television cameras captured authorities walking a suspect completely covered from head to toe in a white biological evidence suit. Police had to use a stun gun on the suspect who was found in a vacant condo. Mesa police say they believe the suspect knew at least one of the motel room victims.
