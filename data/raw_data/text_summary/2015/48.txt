Columbus police are seeking suspects in a shooting that injured four people Friday afternoon at Sims Scott Park. "Columbus councilman Kabir Karriem, who represents Ward 5 where the shooting occurred and was on the scene Friday afternoon, said "unfortunate incidents" like Friday's shooting should compel city officials to craft a more proactive plan for crime prevention. "Our prayers go out to the victims and even the suspects," Karriem said. Fred Shelton said the four victims were taken to Baptist Memorial Hospital-Golden Triangle and treated for non life-threatening injuries. It's incumbent on us as city leaders to make sure our city is safe for our youth and our seniors.
