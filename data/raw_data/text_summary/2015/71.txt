More Video...Rico Doyle (Jail photo)Arrest warrant affidavits released Friday shed some light on a shooting earlier this week at a Killeen apartment complex that left two women dead and three other people injured. He was sentenced to two years in state jail on the homicide charge and received concurrent sentences of four years in prison on the firearms charge and two years in state jail on the drug charge. The officers arrested Doyle on warrants charging two counts of murder and two counts of aggravated assault, Smith said. He was released from the Bartlett State Jail in April 2012. Kysha D. Edmond-Gray, 42 and Deanna Louise Buster, 38, both of Killeen, were shot to death early Tuesday morning.
