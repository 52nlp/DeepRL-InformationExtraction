Three victims, a 25-year-old man, a 26-year-old man, and a 33-year-old man, were all transported to a local hospital for treatment of non-life threatening injuries. Friday morning it was different relatives and friends who identify the men killed as 26-year-old Montrell Burdine and 25-year-old Damario Jones.
