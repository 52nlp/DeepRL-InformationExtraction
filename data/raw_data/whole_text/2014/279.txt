(Photo: Robert Allen / Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo  Police say five people were wounded early Tuesday following a shooting on Detroit's southwest side.  TV reports said the five were among a larger number of people who had gathered outside at Annabelle and Gleason in southwest Detroit.  Police say one person is in serious condition and the others are in stable condition. Police remained on the scene, combing the streets with flashlights.  Louis Pace, 52, who lives in the neighborhood, said he was awakened by the sound of at least 16 gunshots from about three or four separate caliber weapons.  "It wasn't a fight," he said. "It sounded more like it had to be somebody driving. The surveillance didn't pick up anything."  He has camera equipment affixed to his house within steps of the crime scene. Some of the guns were very large, he said.  "And the problem is, some of them sounded like revolvers, so there are no casings" ejected when fired, Pace said.  He said his home in the neighborhood, south of I-75 and not far from the Marathon Detroit refinery, has been in his family since the 1970s. He used to not worry about locking his car doors at night, but now he takes extra precautions, usually parking it in the garage.  "I've seen some of everything," he said.  Pace said young people frequently gather in the area where the shooting happened, but they usually aren't especially loud.  Police are investigating.
